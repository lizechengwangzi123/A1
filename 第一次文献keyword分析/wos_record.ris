AB  - Based on the observational dataset SA-OBS and model outputs from the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble project, this study investigates heatwaves in Southeast Asia in the current and future warmer climate. A heatwave is detected when the daily maximum temperature exceeds the 90th percentile threshold at each grid for at least three consecutive days. Three characteristics describing the frequency, duration, and amplitude of heatwaves are examined, including the sum of heatwave days per year (HWF) satisfying the heatwave definition, the length of the longest yearly heatwave event (HWD), and the hottest amplitude of the hottest yearly heatwave event (HWA). Results indicate that increased global warming is associated with substantial changes in heatwave characteristics over Southeast Asia, with more frequent heatwaves, longer heatwave duration, and higher extreme temperatures. The increase in HWA has a linear growth against global warming levels with distinct regional differences between the Maritime Continent and the Indochina Peninsula due to their different heat content of lower atmospheric boundaries. In contrast, those in HWF and HWD have nonlinear growth characteristics. The projected warmer future tends to be associated with a higher risk ratio value with the occurrence of rarer extreme heatwaves relative to the current climate. These results reiterate the potential risks of extreme regional heatwaves if global warming is unrestricted.

AB  - Background: Heatwaves have received major attention globally due to their detrimental effects on human health and the environment. The frequency, duration, and severity of heatwaves have increased recently due to changes in climatic conditions, anthropogenic forcing, and rapid urbanization. Australia is highly vulnerable to this hazard. Although there have been an increasing number of studies conducted in Australia related to the heatwave phenomena, a systematic review of heatwave vulnerability has rarely been reported in the literature.
   Objectives: This study aims to provide a systematic and overarching review of the different components of heatwave vulnerability (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity) in Australia.
   Methods: A systematic review was conducted using the PRISMA protocol. Peer-reviewed English language articles published between January 2000 and December 2021 were selected using a combination of search keywords in Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. Articles were critically analyzed based on three specific heatwave vulnerability components: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity.
   Results and discussion: A total of 107 articles meeting all search criteria were chosen. Although there has been an increasing trend of heat-related studies in Australia, most of these studies have concentrated on exposure and adaptive capacity components. Evidence suggests that the frequency, severity, and duration of heatwaves in Australian cities has been increasing, and that this is likely to continue under current climate change scenarios. This study noted that heatwave vulnerability is associated with geographical and climatic factors, space, time, socioeconomic and demographic factors, as well as the physiological condition of people. Various heat mitigation and adaptation measures implemented around the globe have proven to be efficient in reducing the impacts of heatwaves.
   Conclusion: This study provides increased clarity regarding the various drivers of heatwave vulnerability in Australia. Such knowledge is crucial in informing extreme heat adaptation and mitigation planning.

AB  - In response to the urgent global threat posed by human-induced extreme climate hazards, heatwaves are still systematically under-reported and under-researched in Thailand. This region is confronting a significant rise in heat-related mortality, which has resulted in hundreds of deaths, underscoring a pressing issue that needs to be addressed. This research article is one of the first to present a solution for assessing heatwave dynamics, using machine learning (ML) algorithms and geospatial technologies in this country. It analyzes heatwave metrics like heatwave number (HWN), heatwave frequency (HWF), heatwave duration (HWD), heatwave magnitude (HWM), and heatwave amplitude (HWA), combining satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) data with ground-based air temperature (T-air) observations from 1981 to 2019. The result reveals significant marked increases in both the frequency and intensity of daytime heatwaves in peri-urban areas, with the most pronounced changes being a 0.45-day/year in HWN, a 2.00-day/year in HWF, and a 0.27-day/year in HWD. This trend is notably less pronounced in urban areas. Conversely, rural regions are experiencing a significant escalation in nighttime heatwaves, with increases of 0.39 days/year in HWN, 1.44 days/year in HWF, and 0.14 days/year in HWD. Correlation analysis (p<0.05) reveals spatial heterogeneity in heatwave dynamics, with robust daytime correlations between T(air )and LST in rural (HWN, HWF, HWD, r>0.90) and peri-urban (HWM, HWA, r>0.65) regions. This study emphasizes the importance of considering microclimatic variations in heatwave analysis, offering insights for targeted intervention strategies. It demonstrates how enhancing remote sensing with ML can facilitate the spatial-temporal analysis of heatwaves across diverse environments. This approach identifies critical risk areas in Thailand, guiding resilience efforts and serving as a model for managing similar microclimates, extending the applicability of this study. Overall, the study provides policymakers and stakeholders with potent tools for climate action and effective heatwave management. Furthermore, this research contributes to mitigating the impacts of extreme climate events, promoting resilience, and fostering environmental sustainability.

AB  - One of the direct and unavoidable consequences of global warming-induced rising temperatures is the more recurrent and severe heatwaves. In recent years, even countries like Malaysia seldom had some mild to severe heatwaves. As the Earth's average temperature continues to rise, heatwaves in Malaysia will undoubtedly worsen in the future. It is crucial to characterize and monitor heat events across time to effectively prepare for and implement preventative actions to lessen heatwave's social and economic effects. This study proposes heatwave-related indices that take into account both daily maximum (Tmax) and daily lowest (Tmin) temperatures to evaluate shifts in heatwave features in Peninsular Malaysia (PM). Daily ERA5 temperature dataset with a geographical resolution of 0.25 degrees for the period 1950-2022 was used to analyze the changes in the frequency and severity of heat waves across PM, while the LandScan gridded population data from 2000 to 2020 was used to calculate the affected population to the heatwaves. This study also utilized Sen's slope for trend analysis of heatwave characteristics, which separates multi-decadal oscillatory fluctuations from secular trends. The findings demonstrated that the geographical pattern of heatwaves in PM could be reconstructed if daily Tmax is more than the 95th percentile for 3 or more days. The data indicated that the southwest was more prone to severe heatwaves. The PM experienced more heatwaves after 2000 than before. Overall, the heatwave-affected area in PM has increased by 8.98 km2/decade and its duration by 1.54 days/decade. The highest population affected was located in the central south region of PM. These findings provide valuable insights into the heatwaves pattern and impact.

AB  - The capacity of vegetation to mitigate excessive urban heat has been well documented. However, the cooling potential provided by urban vegetation during heatwaves is less known even though heatwaves have been projected to be more severe with climate change. Across 24 global metropolises, we combine 30 m resolution satellite observations with a theoretical leaf energy balance model to quantify the change of the leaf-to-air temperature difference and stomatal conductance during heatwaves from 2000 to 2020. We found the responses of urban vegetation to heatwaves differ significantly across cities and they are mediated by climate forcing and human management. During heatwaves, vegetation in Mediterranean and midlatitude-humid cities shows a significant decrease in cooling potential in most cases due to large stomatal closures, while vegetation in arid cities shows a cooling enhancement with an unmodified stomatal opening likely in response to intense irrigation. In comparison, the cooling potential of vegetation in high-latitude humid cities does not show significant changes. These responses have implications for future urban vegetation management strategies and urban planning.

AB  - Background: Global incidence of dengue has surged rapidly over the past decade. Each year, an estimated 390 million infections occur worldwide, with Asia-Pacific countries bearing about three-quarters of the global dengue disease burden. Global warming may influence the pattern of dengue transmission. While previous studies have shown that extremely high temperatures can impede the development of the Aedes mosquito, the effect of such extreme heat over a sustained period, also known as heatwaves, has not been investigated in a tropical climate setting. Aim: We examined the short-term relationships between maximum ambient temperature and heatwaves and reported dengue infections in Singapore, via ecological time series analysis, using data from 2009 to 2018. Methods: We studied the effect of twomeasures of extreme heat - (i) heatwaves and ( ii) maximumambient temperature. We used a negative binomial regression, coupled with a distributed lag nonlinear model, to examine the immediate and lagged associations of extreme temperature on dengue infections, on a weekly timescale. We adjusted for long-term trend, seasonality, rainfall and absolute humidity, public holidays and autocorrelation. Results: We observed an overall inhibitive effect of heatwaves on the risk of dengue infections, and a parabolic relationship between maximum temperature and dengue infections. A 1 degrees C increase inmaximumtemperature from 31 degrees C was associated with a 13.1% (Relative Risk (RR): 0.868, 95% CI: 0.798, 0.946) reduction in the cumulative risk of dengue infections over six weeks. Weeks with 3 heatwave days were associated with a 28.3% (RR: 0.717, 95% CI: 0.608, 0.845) overall reduction compared to weeks with no heatwave days. Adopting different heatwaves specifications did not substantially alter our estimates. Conclusion: Extreme heat was associated with decreased dengue incidence. Findings from this study highlight the importance of understanding the temperature dependency of vector-borne diseases in resource planning for an anticipated climate change scenario.

AB  - Vietnam is highly vulnerable to climate change-related extreme weather events such as heatwaves. This study assesses the association between heatwaves and hospitalizations due to mental and behavioral disorders (MBDs) in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC). We collected daily MBD hospital admissions data at the HCMC Mental Health Hospital from 2017 to 2019. Heatwaves effects were characterized into the main effect (i.e., the intensity of temperature during heatwaves) and the added effect (i.e., the duration of heatwaves). Time series Poisson regression coupled with a distributed lag linear model (DLM) was used to quantify the 14-day lags effect of heatwaves. Confounders including long-term trend, seasonality, days of the week, holidays, and relative humidity were included in the model. Heatwaves increased all-cause MBD hospitalization by 62% (95%Cl, 36-93%) for the main effect and by 8% (95% Cl, - 3% to 19%) for the added effect. Noticeably, the group aged 18-60 years old was affected by the main effect of the heatwave, while the group aged 61 years and older was affected by the added effect of the heatwave. The effects of heatwaves differed among groups of MBD hospitalizations. The mental and behavioral disorder group due to psychoactive substance use was significantly affected by the main effect of heatwaves (RR:2.21; 95%Cl:1.55-3.15). The group of schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders were highly vulnerable towards both the main and the added effect of heatwaves with RR = 1.50 (95%CI, 1.20-1.86) and RR = 1.14 (95%CI, 1.01-1.30), respectively.

AB  - Extreme heat and drought conditions are affecting water availability in many regions worldwide, leading to negative impacts on human societies, agriculture, and ecosystems. However, current research lacks comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis examining the interplay between multiple hydrological factors and heatwave events, especially in the context of climate change. This research broadly pertains to understanding the dynamics of hydrological factors and their potential responses to heatwave during warm seasons across the contiguous United States for the period from 2003 to 2022. Utilizing data from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), we analyzed surface runoff, evapotranspiration (ET), precipitation, Groundwater Storage (GWS), Root Zone Soil Moisture (RZSM), and Total Water Storage (TWS) to discern annual patterns and the impacts of heatwave. The spatial patterns of heatwave highlighted a higher occurrence in the western, central, and northeastern U.S., with longer average durations in the western and south-central regions. These events are predominantly dry, characterized by low Relative Humidity (RH), except in the southeastern U.S., where heatwave coincide with high RH levels. Post-heatwave analysis indicated a reduction in GWS, TWS, RZSM, and ET, alongside an increase in surface runoff, RH, and precipitation. An in-depth examination of rainfall and temperature dynamics during heatwave revealed weak correlations between rainfall and temperature, as well as between rainfall and heatwave duration, highlighting the complex nature of these interactions. The study also found an enhanced probability of rainfall following heatwave, particularly in the eastern regions, drawing attention to the potential for increased Hood risks post-heatwave. Our findings contribute to the growing body of knowledge on the impacts of heatwave on hydrological factors, providing valuable insights for climate change adaptation and water resource management strategies.

AB  - Background: This study aims to investigate the current impacts of extreme temperature and heatwaves on human health in terms of both mortality and morbidity. This systematic review analyzed the impact of heatwaves on mortality, morbidity, and the associated vulnerability factors, focusing on the sensitivity component. Methods: This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 flow checklist. Four databases (Scopus, Web of Science, EBSCOhost, PubMed) were searched for articles published from 2012 to 2022. Those eligible were evaluated using the Navigation Guide Systematic Review framework. Results: A total of 32 articles were included in the systematic review. Heatwave events increased mortality and morbidity incidence. Sociodemographic (elderly, children, male, female, low socioeconomic, low education), medical conditions (cardiopulmonary diseases, renal disease, diabetes, mental disease), and rural areas were crucial vulnerability factors. Conclusions: While mortality and morbidity are critical aspects for measuring the impact of heatwaves on human health, the sensitivity in the context of sociodemographic, medical conditions, and locality posed a higher vulnerability to certain groups. Therefore, further research on climate change and health impacts on vulnerability may help stakeholders strategize effective plans to reduce the effect of heatwaves.

AB  - Platanus x acerifolia (London Plane) is a widely planted street tree throughout cities in temperate and Mediterranean climates. Heatwave intensity and frequency is likely to increase in these cities as a combined result of the urban heat island and climate change. High air temperature during heatwaves can lead to canopy leaf loss in vulnerable tree species, such as P. acerifolia. This rapid change in canopy cover may lead to subsequent reductions in ecosystem service benefits, such as shade cooling, human well-being, pollution interception and stormwater interception. This study investigates canopy leaf loss in two streets planted with P. acerifolia trees following a summer heatwave and the impacts upon street micrometeorological conditions and human thermal comfort. The plant area index of P. acerifolia, trees, and the micrometeorological conditions under and away from these trees was measured before and after a >43 degrees C heatwave in Melbourne, Australia. Physiological equivalent temperature was calculated from micrometeorological parameters to estimate human thermal comfort. Canopy loss was significant (30-50 %) and rapid and reduced thermal comfort benefits provided by canopy shade on two of the three warm summer days measured after the heatwave. However, the under-canopy areas of the street maintained a cooler micrometeorological conditions than areas in the open. This study suggests that as summer air temperature extremes and heatwave frequency increase in urban areas, more vulnerable urban tree species may experience sparse canopy cover throughout summer months reducing some ecosystem service benefits when they are needed most.

AB  - More frequent and intense heatwaves in the last decade have challenged humanitarian, health and meteorological authorities to mitigate impact. Meteorological heatwave monitoring and prediction services vary between heatwave definitions which either include humidity or are based only on temperature. Incorporation of humidity into human health heatwave studies and warning services has been variable. Whilst higher humidity is a known stressor during heatwaves, humidity is known to confound interpretation of heatwave data and can be difficult to monitor and forecast.
   This study examines the effect of humidity on diagnosed heatwave severity across Australia's diverse climate zones. Dry bulb temperature is used as the only input into the Bureau of Meteorology's current operational Excess Heat Factor (EHF) index. Alternative humidity-affected temperature indices (Apparent Temperature, Wet Bulb Globe Temperature and Heat Index) are examined for suitability as input to EHF to compare the incidence of dry and humidity-affected heatwave severity within Australia. This paper uses maximum and minimum dry and humidity affected temperature indices extracted from Australia's Bureau of Meteorology Atmospheric highresolution Regional Reanalysis for Australia (BARRA).
   Our investigation demonstrates Australia's operational temperature-only percentile-based heatwave severity service provides effective heatwave warning guidance for five of Australia's six diverse climate zones. However, rare very dry or very humid heatwaves in the tropics require both dry bulb temperature-only and Heat Index versions of Excess Heat Factor (EHF) severity index to provide competent operational heatwave early warning guidance.

AB  - As the global climate warms, cities worldwide face more frequent and extreme heatwaves. These events can affect human health and decrease liveability. While the mitigating effects of vegetation on land surface temperature (LST) are well characterised at large spatial scales and during typical weather conditions, the cooling benefits that urban greening can provide at local scales, particularly during summer heatwaves, are poorly quantified.
   We quantified LST variation across an urban landscape to assess relationships with land use and vegetation cover from land unit (average similar to 460 m(2)) to suburb scale (similar to 1.66 km(2)) under extreme summer heat conditions. High resolution (2 m), dayand night-time LST was measured at the peak of a heatwave event, after three consecutive days with air temperature exceeding 40 degrees C, by flying an aircraft fitted with a thermal imager over 90 suburbs in Adelaide, Australia. Daytime, night-time, and diurnal range LST distributions were related to measures of land use, vegetation cover (i.e., tree, grass) and urban morphology at both the suburb and land unit scale.
   At the suburb scale, vegetation cover did not affect LST. However, at the land unit scale, tree canopy cover, and to a lesser extent grass cover, decreased local LST by up to 6 degrees C during the day, but not at night. Overall nighttime LST was poorly predicted by the land use and land cover predictors. Moving inland from the coast, small vegetation patches, mostly contained in yards and gardens, was associated with the greatest localised LST reductions in the hotter inland suburbs. LST within land units was further decreased during the day when vegetation was present within 30 m buffers around each land unit, suggesting a moderate landscape cooling effect on LST.
   Our results suggest that even small urban vegetation patches can be managed to provide substantial heat mitigation during increasingly frequent summer heatwaves, particularly around the residential environments where people live.

AB  - Heatwaves have caused significant damage to human health, infrastructure, and economies in recent decades, and the occurrences of heatwaves are becoming more frequent and severe across the globe under climate change. The previous studies on heatwaves have primarily focused on air temperature, neglecting other variables like wind speed, relative humidity, and radiation, which could lead to a serious underestimation of the adverse effects of heatwaves. To address this issue, this study proposed to the use of more sophisticated thermal indices, such as universal thermal climate index (UTCI) and apparent temperature (AT), to define heatwaves and carry out a comprehensive heatwave assessment over mainland southeast Asia (MSEA) from 1961 to 2020. The traditional temperature-based method was also compared. The results of the study demonstrate that the annual maximum temperature in heatwave days (HWA) and the annual average temperature in heatwave days (HWM) are significantly underestimated if only air temperature is considered. However, UTCI and AT tend to predict a lower frequency of yearly heatwave occurrences and shorter durations. Trend analysis indicates a general increase in heatwave occurrences across MSEA under all thermal indices in the past six decades, particularly in the last 30 years. This study's approach and findings provide a holistic view of heatwave characteristics based on thermal indices and highlight the risk of intensified heat stress during heatwaves in MSEA.

AB  - Background: There is growing evidence in support of a short-term association between ambient temperature and cardiac arrest attacks that is a serious manifestation of cardiovascular disease and has a high incidence and low survival rate. However, it remains unrecognized about the hazardous temperature exposure types, exposure risk magnitude, and vulnerable populations. Objectives: We comprehensively summarize prior epidemiological studies looking at the short-term associations of outof-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with various temperature exposures among different populations. Methods: We searched PubMed and Web of Science databases from inception to October 2021 for eligible English language. Temperature exposure was categorized into three types: heat (included high temperature, extreme heat, and heatwave), cold (included low temperature and extreme cold), and temperature variation (included diurnal temperature range and temperature change between two adjacent days). Meta-analysis weighted by inverse variance was used to pool effect estimates. Results: This study included 15 studies from 8 countries, totaling around 1 million OHCA events. Extreme heat and extreme cold were significantly associated with an increased risk of OHCA, and the pooled relative risks (RRs) were 1.071 [95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.019-1.126] and 1.662 (95%CI: 1.138-2.427), respectively. The risk of OHCA was also elevated by heatwaves (RR = 1.248, 95%CI: 1.091-1.427) and more intensive heatwaves had a greater effect. Notably, the elderly and males seemed to be more vulnerable to the effects of heat and cold. However, we did not observe a significant association between temperature variation and the risk of OHCA (1.005, 95%CI: 0.999-1.012). Conclusion: Short-term exposure to heat and cold may be novel risk factors for OHCA. Considering available studies in limited regions, the temperature effect on OHCA should be urgently confirmed in different regions.

AB  - Climate change has caused a rise in temperature extremes, particularly heatwaves, in recent decades. Physical-empirical models are developed in this study using two classical machine learning algorithms, namely decision tree (DT) and random forests, and a novel hybrid technique consists of Ada-Boost Regression and decision tree (ABR-DT) for forecasting annual heatwave days (HWDs) of Iran from synoptic predictors. The daily temperature data of Princeton Meteorological Forcing were extracted for 27 points to estimate the annual number of HWDs, and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction reanalysis data were used as predictors. The major synoptic variables were extracted for four pressure levels (e.g., 300, 500, 850, and 1000 hPa) and three monthly time lags. The Principal Component Analysis was employed to reduce the diverse predictors and their features to the most optimal structure. The grid point-based performance evaluation revealed the superiority of ABR-DT, which showed a correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.860 and meant absolute error (MAE) of 6.929, using only specific humidity and wind component as predictors. The spatial performance indices over eight different climate regions of Iran also showed the better performance of ABR-DT, which improved the CC and MAE of its two alternatives up to 185 and 19%. The study identified the optimal parameter combination as the predictors of heatwaves by examining the effects of numerous weather components. The results proved the proposed hybrid forecasting approach's effectiveness in predicting heatwave days, a devastating hazard, for many regions.

AB  - Climate change and heatwaves challenge urban dwellers' thermal comfort and health. In Hong Kong, more frequent and intensive extreme heat has been observed recently. This study uses Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to observe vertical wind profiles and calibrate numerical simulation methods for urban ventilation assessment in nighttime extreme heat (i.e. hot nights (HNs)) at a high-density site. A cross-comparison is conducted to the characteristics between the observed HN-averaged wind profiles and commonly-used 24-h-period averaged wind profiles in summer. The observation reveals a weaker wind environment in HNs than 24-h -periods, and the weakest condition is found in HNs during prolonged extreme heat where the impacts of weakened advection surpass enhanced thermal buoyancy. Furthermore, CFD simulations are conducted to evaluate the deviations on urban ventilation assessment caused by the lack of consideration of nighttime extreme heat when setting inlet wind profiles and site thermal conditions. In the simulation results, the 24-h-period-averaged wind profiles cause significant deviations on pedestrian-level wind speed and velocity ratio (empirical model (>45%); LiDAR observation (>20%)). Considerable deviations are found when unstable thermal stratification is ignored (>20%). Consistent deviations on vertical turbulent flow structures induced by the inexplicit coupling between thermal buoyancy and advection are found. The findings call for urgent attention to the wind conditions in HNs since they are most needed for releasing heat stress and urban overheating. It is recommended to include explicit buoyancy effects in both measurement and modeling works to optimize urban ventilation assessment for tackling extremely high-temperature and weak-wind conditions.

AB  - Rising temperatures due to global warming necessitate immediate evaluation of heatwave patterns in Peninsular Malaysia (PM). For this purpose, this study utilized a locally developed heatwave index and a gridded daily maximum temperature (Tmax) dataset from ERA5 (1950-2022). During validation, the ERA5 dataset accurately represented the spatial pattern of Level 1 heatwaves, showing widespread occurrence. Historically, Level 1 heatwaves prevailed at 63.0%, followed by Level 2 at 27.7%, concentrated in northwestern states and the enclave between the Tahan and Titiwangsa mountain ranges. During very strong El Nino events in 1982/83, 1997/98, and 2015/16, Level 2 heatwave distributions were 10.4%, 26.8%, and 15.0%, respectively. For future projection, the model ensemble was created by selecting top-performing Global Climate Models (GCMs) using Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), ranked re-aggregation with compromise programming index (CPI), and GCM subset selection via Fisher-Jenks. The linear scaling bias-corrected GCMs (BC-GCMs), NorESM2-LM, ACCESS-CM2, MPI-ESM1-2-LR, ACCESS-ESM1-5, and FGOALS-g3, were found to exhibit better performance, and then ensemble. March to May show the highest increase in all scenarios, ranging from 3.3 degrees C to 4.4 degrees C for Level 1 heatwaves and 4.1 degrees C to 10.7 degrees C for Level 2 heatwaves. In the near future, SSP5-8.5 projects up to a 40.5% spatial increase for Level 1 heatwaves and a 2.3% increase for Level 2 heatwaves, affecting 97.1% and 57.2% of the area, respectively. In the far future, under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5, Tmax is projected to rise rapidly (1.5-4.5 degrees C) in the northern, western, and central regions, with increasing population exposure anticipated in the northern and western regions.

AB  - Tropical coastal areas are increasingly exposed to temperature extremes from marine heatwaves and contaminants from anthropogenic activities. The interactive effects of these environmental changes on marine life are understudied. We investigated the direct and cross-generational effects of copper (Cu) on F0 and F1 generations of the common tropical copepod Pseudodiaptomus annandalei under extreme temperatures (30 and 34 degrees C). In F0, Cu exposure reduced survival and nauplii production; these patterns were more pronounced at 34 degrees C and in females. F0 Copepods produced more faecal pellets at 34 degrees C than 30 degrees C, indicating a higher energetic demand. In F1, the number of F1 adults was lower in CueF0 and at 34 degrees C. Cu-exposed F0 produced larger adult F1, while exposure to 34 degrees C resulted in smaller adult F1. Our results show that tropical copepods are highly vulnerable to the interactive effects of contaminants and extreme temperatures.

AB  - The successive flood-heat extreme (SFHE) event, which threatens the securities of human health, economy, and building environment, has attracted extensive research attention recently. However, the potential changes in SFHE characteristics and the global population exposure to SFHE under anthropogenic warming remain unclear. Here, we present a globalscale evaluation of the projected changes and uncertainties in SFHE characteristics (frequency, intensity, duration, land exposure) and population exposure under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 and 6.0 scenarios, based on the multi-model ensembles (five global water models forced by four global climate models) within the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project 2b framework. The results reveal that, relative to the 1970-1999 baseline period, the SFHE frequency is projected to increase nearly globally by the end of this century, especially in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (>20 events/30-year) and the tropical regions (e.g., northern South America, central Africa, and southeastern Asia, >15 events/30-year). The projected higher SFHE frequency is generally accompanied by a larger model uncertainty. By the end of this century, the SFHE land exposure is expected to increase by 12 % (20 %) under RCP2.6 (RCP6.0), and the intervals between flood and heatwave in SFHE tend to decrease by up to 3 days under both RCPs, implying the more intermittent SFHE occurrence under future warming. The SFHE events will lead to the higher population exposure in the Indian Peninsula and central Africa (<10 million person-days) and eastern Asia (<5 million person-days) due to the higher population density and the longer SFHE duration. Partial correlation analysis indicates that the contribution of flood to the SFHE frequency is greater than that of heatwave for most global regions, but the SFHE frequency is dominated by the heatwave in northern North America and northern Asia.

AB  - Tropical fish are fast-growing and high energetic-demand organisms, which can be highly vulnerable to long-lasting effects of heat stress and pollution, particularly under food shortages. We tested this by assessing high-ly complex direct and delayed interactive effects of an extreme temperature (ET, 32 degrees C) from a simulated marine heatwave (MHW), copper (Cu, 0, 100, 150 and 175 mu g L-1) and food availability (limited and saturated food) on early juveniles of a tropical, reef-associated seaperch (Psammoperca waigiensis). Cu, ET, and food limitation independently reduced survival and growth, partly explained by reduced feeding. The negative effect of Cu on fish survival was more substantial under ET, particularly under limited food. Delayed interactive effects of Cu, ET, and food limitation were still lethal to fish juveniles during the post-exposure period. These results indicate that reef-associated fish juveniles are highly vulnerable to these dominant stressors, impairing their ecological function as predators in the coral reefs.

AB  - The Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage has identified increasing temperatures as a key slow onset event. However, it is the resulting increases in short-term heat events - heatwaves - that have so far been the primary focus of risk assessment and policy, while gradual and sustained increases in temperature have received less attention. This is a global issue but particularly important in tropical and subtropical regions already chronically exposed to extreme heat. This paper reviews recent analyses of intensifying seasonal and year-round extreme heat exposures and how this affects daily life, including worker productivity, health and wellbeing, reduced GDP and economic viability. It frames this as a slow onset event and closes with a brief indication of tools available to assess and address these risks.

AB  - With rapid urbanisation, changes to the urban environment and climate are inevitable. This exacerbates the risks for meteorological hazard such as heatwaves where this is one of the common issues faced by major cities worldwide. Heat related issues pose an impact not only to the environment but also lead to heat related human health problems, economic loss to businesses, damages to infrastructures and in extreme cases, cause deaths. Poor urban designs that are characterised by the abundance of grey infrastructures increase the impact on urban climate with the potential of intensifying heatwaves and urban heat island (UHI) effects. Additionally, these grey designs also limit recreational participation. Re-naturing cities using green infrastructure can provide nature-based solutions that can be useful in mitigating the abovementioned meteorological hazards. Therefore, understanding the impact of re-naturing cities using green infrastructures (GI) on microclimate mitigations, human thermal comfort improvement and recreational participation is beneficial in improving the urban environment and ensuring the wellbeing of urban citizens. This paper provides justifications on implementing nature based solutions using green infrastructures in cities, thus improving future urban planning that potentially increases cities' resilience to environmental hazards.

AB  - The increasing frequency and intensity of heat events have weighty impacts on public health in Vietnam, but their effects vary across regions. In this study, we have applied a vulnerability assessment framework (VAF) to systematically assess the spatial pattern of health vulnerability to heatwaves in Vietnam. The VAF was computed as the function of three dimensions: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity, with the indicators for each dimension derived from the relevant literature, consultation with experts, and available data. An analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to determine the weight of indicators. Each province in Vietnam's vulnerability to the health impacts of heatwaves was evaluated by applying the vulnerability index, computed using 13 indicators (sensitivity index, 9; adaptive capacity index, 3; and exposure index, 1). As a result of this analysis, this study has identified heatwave vulnerability 'hotspots', primarily in the Southeast, Central Highlands, and South Central Coast of Vietnam. However, these hotspots are not necessarily the same as the area most vulnerable to climate change, because some areas that are more sensitive to heatwaves may have a higher capacity to adapt to them due to a host of factors including their population characteristics (e.g. rates of the elderly or children), socio-economic and geographical conditions, and the availability of air-conditioners. This kind of information, provided by the vulnerability index framework, allows policymakers to determine how to more efficiently allocate resources and devise appropriate interventions to minimise the impact of heatwaves with strategies tailored to each region of Vietnam.

AB  - Ocean temperatures increased during the 20th century and are predicted to continue to rise during the 21st century. Simultaneously, the extreme phenomena of shorter time ocean warming, known as Marine Heatwaves (MHWs), are also taking place. The present study used the Daily Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (DOISST) v2.1 with a spatial resolution of 0.25. The time period of the DOISST data used in this study was from January 1, 1982 to December 31, 2020, and the region was 90 degrees E-150 degrees E and 16 degrees S-16 degrees N, which is divided into 11 Fishing Management Areas (FMAs). MHWs have a set of metrics derived from the SST data to describe the statistical characteristics of each event. To examine and quantify the influence of the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean, we used the Nino 3.4 SST index and the Dipole Mode Index (DMI), respectively. Based on the data analysis, there has been an increase in the duration and frequency of the occurrence of MHWs in the study area, with the highest increase occurring in FMA 573, FMA 716, and FMA 711. Based on the severity, MHWs in Indonesia are dominated by category I, which is dominantly located in FMA 716, category II in FMA 573, category III with the center of events in FMA 771, and category IV with irregular spatial patterns.

AB  - This paper reviews urban heat (UrHT) challenges following the SBAR (situation, background, assessment and recommendation) framework. The results indicate that heatwaves become more frequent, lasting and intense, especially after 1990s. Above 1960s level, heatwaves across China doubled in both magnitude and frequency by 2018. Jianghuai and Southern China underwent the largest magnitude and most widespread increases. Under 1.5 ? warming limit, the average heatwave days and duration across China will increase by 10.8 days and 3.9 days. Drought-heatwave co-occurrence is increasingly frequent at 7-11%/decade (from 1961 to 2018) and the co-occurrence leads to more intense heatwaves. UHIs are a common issue for almost all Chinese cities and UHIs have been aggravating annually. Daytime UHIs peak in summer, indicating the synergies with heatwaves. The synergies are prominent in southeastern cities for strong summer daytime UHIs in eastern cities and intense heatwaves in southern regions. UrHTs have not been recognised and there are no dedicated/mandatory plans. Mega-challenges of climate change, rapid urbanisation, carbon- and labour-intensive economic growth and demographic changes can potentially lock China into UrHT challenges. Addressing UrHT challenges is urgent in China not only for environmental, ecosystem, social and health consequences, but also for economic impacts relevant to labour, capital, and goods or services. Efforts are suggested in technical improvement, policy formulation, social participation, economic investment and co-benefit approach recognition. Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive understanding of heat-related challenges in China and can guide the creation of cool cities and communities in practice.

AB  - Background
   Many studies have shown associations between rising temperatures, El Nino events and dengue incidence, but the effect of sustained periods of extreme high temperatures (i.e., heatwaves) on dengue outbreaks has not yet been investigated. This study aimed to compare the short-term temperature-dengue associations during different dengue outbreak periods, estimate the dengue cases attributable to temperature, and ascertain if there was an association between heatwaves and dengue outbreaks in Hanoi, Vietnam.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   Dengue outbreaks were assigned to one of three categories (small, medium and large) based on the 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of distribution of weekly dengue cases during 2008-2016. Using a generalised linear regression model with a negative binomial link that controlled for temporal trends, temperature variation, rainfall and population size over time, we examined and compared associations between weekly average temperature and weekly dengue incidence for different outbreak categories. The same model using weeks with or without heatwaves as binary variables was applied to examine the potential effects of extreme heatwaves, defined as seven or more days with temperatures above the 95th percentile of daily temperature distribution during the study period. This study included 55,801 dengue cases, with an average of 119 (range: 0 to 1454) cases per week. The exposure response relationship between temperature and dengue risk was non-linear and differed with dengue category. After considering the delayed effects of temperature (one week lag), we estimated that 4.6%, 11.6%, and 21.9% of incident cases during small, medium, and large outbreaks were attributable to temperature. We found evidence of an association between heatwaves and dengue outbreaks, with longer delayed effects on large outbreaks (around 14 weeks later) than small and medium outbreaks (4 to 9 weeks later). Compared with non-heatwave years, dengue outbreaks (i.e., small, moderate and large outbreaks combined) in heatwave years had higher weekly number of dengue cases (p<0.05). Findings were robust under different sensitivity analyses.
   Conclusions
   The short-term association between temperature and dengue risk varied by the level of outbreaks and temperature seems more likely affect large outbreaks. Moreover, heatwaves may delay the timing and increase the magnitude of dengue outbreaks.

AB  - In the past decade, the inevitable increase in temperature has caused Malaysia to experience more extreme heat events, and yet very little research has been dedicated in exploring the heat-related vulnerability of exposed population. In this study, the extreme heat vulnerability index (EHVI) has been evaluated to identify the most vulnerable districts to extreme heat events. We evaluated exposure, population sensitivity and adaptive capacity from sociodemographic and remote sensing data. We have applied multivariate analysis on 13 indicators for every 87 districts to elucidate the extreme heat vulnerability in Peninsular Malaysia. The EHVI was generated by summing up the normalized extreme heat exposure scores and factor scores from the multivariate analysis. Our findings clarify that the most vulnerable populations are confined in the urban and northern region of Peninsular Malaysia. The source of vulnerability varied between both regions, with urbanization and population density increase the vulnerability in urban areas, high heat exposure and sensitive population are the dominant factors of vulnerability in the northern region. These findings are valuable in identifying districts vulnerable to extreme heat and help regulatory body; in designing effective adaptation and preparedness strategies to increase the population resilience towards extreme heat.

AB  - There have been several studies on heatwaves (11W) in Vietnam but they all focused on an individual heatwave characteristic. A comprehensive understanding of heat waves is crucial for effective research on their impacts and for making plans for climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies in the country. This study investigates the spatial variability and changing trends in heatwave characteristics across the climatic sub-regions of Vietnam. The analysis is based on the observed daily maximum temperature (Tx) recorded at 144 meteorological stations in the period of 1980-2018. 11W is identified using a relative threshold, which is the local 90`" percentile of Tx within 183 days during the summer On April - 30th September). Results showed that: (1) The threshold values used to determine 11W events varied among sub-regions and stations due to their geographical locations; (2) Across the country, HWs were observed to be more frequent, intense, severe, and longer-lasting in the North Delta and North Central subregions compared to others; (3) Over recent decades, both the frequency and severity of HWs have significantly increased across Vietnam, particularly in the North-Delta and North Central sub-regions. However, the changing trends in HW duration and intensity remain unclear.

AB  - Heatwaves are one of the most dangerous natural hazards causing more than 166,000 deaths from 1998-2017. Their frequency is increasing, and they are becoming more intense.
   Electric fans are an efficient, and sustainable solution to cool people. They are, for most applications, the cheapest cooling technology available. However, many national and international health guidelines actively advise people not to use them when indoor air temperatures exceed the skin temperature, approximately 35 degrees C.
   We used a human energy balance model, to verify the validity of those recommendations and to determine under which environmental (air temperature, relative humidity, air speed and mean radiant temperature) and personal (metabolic rate, clothing) conditions the use of fans would be beneficial.
   We found that current guidelines are too restrictive. Electric fans can be used safely even if the indoor dry-bulb temperature exceeds 35 degrees C since they significantly increase the amount of sweat that evaporates from the skin. The use of elevated air speeds (0.8 m/s) increases the critical operative temperature at which heat strain is expected to occur by an average of 14 degrees C for relative humidity values above 22 %. We also analyzed the most extreme weather events from 1990 to 2014 recorded in the 115 most populous cities worldwide, and we determined that in 93 of them the use of fans would have been beneficial.
   We developed a free, open-source, and easy-to-use online tool to help researchers, building practitioners, and policymakers better understand under which conditions electric fans can be safely used to cool people.

TI  - A heatwave of accretion energy traced by masers in the G358-MM1 high-mass protostar
T2  - NATURE ASTRONOMY
LA  - English
KW  - METHANOL MASERS
AB  - A ring of maser emission seemingly expanding at 0.05 c is actually tracing the propagation of heat through the circumstellar medium around a high-mass protostar rather than subluminal motion. The heatwave is a manifestation of an accretion burst.
   High-mass stars are thought to accumulate much of their mass via short, infrequent bursts of disk-aided accretion(1,2). Such accretion events are rare and difficult to observe directly but are known to drive enhanced maser emission(3-6). In this Letter we report high-resolution, multi-epoch methanol maser observations toward G358.93-0.03, which reveal an interesting phenomenon: the subluminal propagation of a thermal radiation 'heatwave' emanating from an accreting high-mass protostar. The extreme transformation of the maser emission implies a sudden intensification of thermal infrared radiation from within the inner (40-mas, 270-au) region. Subsequently, methanol masers trace the radial passage of thermal radiation through the environment at >= 4% of the speed of light. Such a high translocation rate contrasts with the <= 10 km s(-1) physical gas motions of methanol masers typically observed using very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI). The observed scenario can readily be attributed to an accretion event in the high-mass protostar G358.93-0.03-MM1. While being the third case in its class, G358.93-0.03-MM1 exhibits unique attributes hinting at a possible 'zoo' of accretion burst types. These results promote the advantages of maser observations in understanding high-mass-star formation, both through single-dish maser monitoring campaigns and via their international cooperation as VLBI arrays.

AB  - Warming could facilitate the intensification of toxic algal blooms, two important stressors for marine organisms that are predicted to co-occur more frequently in the future. We investigated the immediate and delayed effects of a heatwave and a simulated bloom (3 x 106 cells L-1) of the diarrhetic shellfish toxin (DST)-producing benthic dinofla-gellate Prorocentrum lima on the survival, physiology (oxygen consumption rate, condition index, immune parameters), and toxin accumulation in the Pacific rock oyster Magallana (Crassostrea) gigas. Oysters exposed to both stressors contained higher mean DST concentrations (mean & PLUSMN; 1 SE: 173.3 & PLUSMN; 19.78 & mu;g kg-1 soft tissue) than those exposed to P. lima bloom alone (120.4 & PLUSMN; 20.90 & mu;g kg-1) and exceeded the maximum permitted levels for human consumption. Exposure to individual stressors and their combination modified the physiology of M. gigas. Oysters exposed to heatwave alone had significantly higher oxygen consumption rates (0.7 & PLUSMN; 0.06 mg O2 h-1 g-1) than the control (0.3 & PLUSMN; 0.06 mg O2 h-1 g-1). However, this was not observed in oysters exposed to both heatwave and P. lima (0.5 & PLUSMN; 0.06 mg O2h-1 g-1). This alteration of the metabolic response to warming in the presence of P. lima may affect the ability of rock oysters to adapt to environmental stressors (i.e., a heatwave) to ensure survival. Immunomodulation, through changes in total hemocyte count, was observed in oysters exposed to P. lima alone and in combination with warming. Individual stressors and their combination did not influence the condition index, but one mortality was re-corded in oysters exposed to both stressors. The findings of this study highlight the vulnerability of rock oysters to the predicted increased frequency of heatwaves and toxic algal blooms, and the increased likelihood of shellfish contain-ing higher than regulatory levels of DST in warming coasts.

AB  - Background: Heatwaves have long been recognised as a serious public health concern. This study was aimed at developing and validating a Malay-version of a questionnaire for evaluating knowledge, risk perception, attitudes, and practices regarding heatwaves. Method: The knowledge construct was evaluated with item analysis and internal reliability. The psychometric characteristics, construct and discriminant validity, and internal consistency of the risk perception, attitude and practice constructs were evaluated with exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Results: The 16 items in the knowledge construct had a good difficulty, discrimination, and reliability index of 0.81. A total of 16 items were maintained in EFA with Cronbach's alpha of 0.84 and 0.82, 0.78 and 0.84 obtained for total items and risk perception, attitude, and practice constructs, respectively. A total of 15 items were retained after CFA. The finalised model met the fitness indices threshold. The convergent and discriminant validity were good. Conclusion: This newly developed Malay-version KRPAP questionnaire is reliable and valid for assessing Malaysians' knowledge, risk perception, attitudes, and practices regarding heatwaves.

AB  - Seagrasses are foundation species that provide ecosystem functions and services, including increased biodiversity, sediment retention, carbon sequestration, and fish nursery habitat. However, anthropogenic stressors that reduce water quality, impose large-scale climate changes, and amplify weather patterns, such as marine heatwaves, are altering seagrass meadow configurations. Quantifying large-scale trends in seagrass distributions will help evaluate the impacts of climate drivers on their functions and services. Here, we quantified spatiotemporal dynamics in abundances and configurations of intertidal and shallow subtidal seagrass (Zostera muelleri) meadows in 20 New Zealand (NZ) estuaries that span a 5-year period (mid/late 2016-early 2022) just before, during and after the Tasman Sea 2017/18 marine heatwave, the warmest summer ever recorded in NZ. We used high-resolution PlanetScope satellite imagery to map interseasonal seagrass extent and quantify seascape metrics across 20 estuaries along a latitudinal gradient spanning 12 degrees in NZ. We also explored the association of changes in seagrass metrics with satellite-derived predictors such as sea surface temperature (SST), SST anomaly (SSTa), water column turbidity, and nutrient concentration. Our analyses revealed that NZ seagrass meadows varied in areal extent between years and seasons, but with no clear patterns over the 5-year period, implying resilience to large-scale stressors like the 2017/18 marine heatwave. Small-scale patterns were also dynamic, for example, patch sizes and patch configurations differed across estuaries, seasons, and years. Furthermore, seagrass patches expanded in some estuaries with increasing SST and SSTa. These results highlight dynamic seagrass patterns that likely affect local processes such as biodiversity and carbon sequestration. Our analyses demonstrate that a combination of high-resolution satellite remote sensing and seascape metrics is an efficient and novel approach to detect impacts from anthropogenic stressors, like eutrophication and climate changes, and climate extremes like cyclones and heatwaves.

AB  - The frequency of marine heatwaves (MHWs) events has been rising globally in recent years, and this trend is expected to continue in the region off the coast of south Java Island. These oceanic extreme events may have the potential to devastate marine habitats, ecosystems and fisheries. This paper characterized MHWs off south Java from 1982 to 2019 using satellite-observed sea surface temperature. The aim of this study was to examine the dynamics of MHWs in one of Indonesia's most important fisheries hotspots, located in the southeast of the tropical Indian Ocean. We have identified two strong MHWs events in 1998 and 2016, both of which started in the austral winter months. Both events were lasted through the spring before dissipating in the early austral winter. These intense MHWs were likely related to a strong El Nino and decreased monsoon activity.

AB  - Heatwaves are increasingly recognized as a severe natural hazard that pose substantial threats to human wellbeing and sustainability with physical, mental, and economic impacts. Heatwave Early Warning Systems (HEWSs) have emerged as a promising solution to mitigate these adverse impacts. This study aims to valuate a Short Message Service (SMS)-based early warning system specifically targeting heat-vulnerable populations and their determinants in central Vietnam, an area prone to heat-related illnesses. By employing the contingent valuation method, individuals' willingness to pay (WTP) for the warning system and the determinants of the WTP were assessed. The findings showed an average WTP of VND 283,110 (similar to USD 11) per person per year, according to the parametric estimate. The total WTP for the affected population in central Vietnam reached VND 857,283,678,000 or USD 37,273,203 per year, assuming that 50% of the heat-vulnerable population contributes to HEWSs financially. Significant determinants of WTP were identified, including bid levels, cost of heat-related illnesses, background diseases, and exposure to heat. Policymakers and health authorities can utilize these findings to develop effective adaptation strategies for preventing and mitigating heat-related illnesses, while also promoting sustainable development in central Vietnam.

AB  - Many efficient forecasting models have been found to fail or show low skill due to the changes in the predictor-predictand relationship with the changes in global climate. An attempt has been taken to develop a climate change resilient heatwave prediction model using machine learning (ML) algorithms known as Support Vector Machines (SVM), random forest and artificial neural network. The National Centres for Environmental Prediction/National Centre for Atmospheric Research reanalysis data of ocean-atmospheric variables were used as the predictors of ML models for forecasting the number of heatwave days (HWDs) in the summer of Pakistan. An SVM based recursive feature elimination method was used to select the skilful predictors. The ML models were developed by considering a moving window of 29 years with a time step of 5 years to incorporate the changes in the relation of HWDs with its predictors due to climate change. The result showed changes in the relationship of HWDs with all the ocean-atmospheric variables considered in this study as probable predictors, which indicates the necessity of forward-rolling approach proposed in this study for the development of climate change resilient forecasting model. The relative performance of ML showed the higher capability of SVM to predict HWDs with an %NRMSE of 36, R-2 of 0.87, md score of 0.76 and an rSD of 0.88 during the validation period. The result revealed the potential of SVM model to be used for reliable forecasting of heatwaves in the context of climate change.

AB  - Extreme temperatures from marine heatwaves (MHWs) and pollution are dominant stressors in tropical marine ecosystems. However, we know little about the role of transgenerational effects of metals and MHWs in shaping the offspring's vulnerability to these stressors. We addressed this fundamental knowledge gap by exposing the planktonic copepod Pseudodiaptomus incisus to copper (Cu: control, 15 and 60 mu g L-1) under 2 temperatures (30 and a simulated marine heatwave at 34 degrees C) in the first generation (F1) and 16 treatments in F2: offspring from each of 4 F1 conditions (control or 15 mu g Cu L-1 x 30 or 34 degrees C) was reared in 4 F2 conditions (control or 15 mu g Cu L-1 x 30 or 34 degrees C). We assessed changes in copepod performance, particularly survival, adult size, grazing, and reproduction. In F1, Cu or marine heatwave (MHW) exposures reduced all fitness traits of F1; the effects were particularly strong when both stressors were present. Transgenerational effects of Cu or MHW also strongly reduced F2 performance. Direct Cu and MHW effects on the offspring were further strengthened by transgenerational effects, resulting in more substantial reductions in F2 performance when both generations were exposed to these stressors. As copepods are major food resources for corals, shrimps, or fish larvae and juveniles, strong transgenerational and direct effects of Cu and MHW can have a cascading effect on entire coastal food webs. These results highlight the importance of considering the interaction of transgenerational and direct effects of multiple stressors, particularly relevant for short-lived organisms in tropical marine ecosystems.

AB  - The detrimental impact of extreme heat exposure on the health and well-being of children is widely acknowledged. The direct and indirect effects of climate change have led to an increased risk of certain cardiovascular events which may be particularly harmful to children who are born with, or develop, heart disease. Purpose: To highlight the worrying paucity of investigative research aimed at differentiating how higher ambient temperatures further tax an already compromised cardiovascular system in children. Methods: This commentary describes basic thermoregulatory concepts relevant to the healthy pediatric population and summarizes common heart diseases observed in this population. Results: We describe how heat stress and exercise are important factors clinicians should more readily consider when treating children with heart disease. Countermeasures to physical inactivity are suggested for children, parents, clinicians, and policymakers to consider. Conclusions: As sudden, excessive heat exposures continue to impact our rapidly warming world, vulnerable populations like children with underlying heart conditions are at greater heat health risk, especially when coupled with the negative physical activity and fitness trends observed worldwide.

AB  - Kelps are important foundation species in coastal ecosystems currently experiencing pronounced shifts in their distribution patterns caused by ocean warming. While some populations found at species' warm distribution edges have been recently observed to decline, expansions of some species have been recorded at their cold distribution edges. Reduced population resilience can contribute to kelp habitat loss, hence, understanding intraspecific variations in physiological responses across a species' latitudinal distribution is crucial for its conservation. To investigate potential local responses of the broadly distributed kelp Saccharina latissima to marine heatwaves in summer, we collected sporophytes from five locations in Europe (Spitsbergen, Bodo, Bergen, Helgoland, Locmariaquer), including populations exposed to the coldest and warmest local temperature regimes. Meristematic tissue from sporophytes was subjected to increasing temperatures of Delta+2, Delta+4 and Delta+6 degrees C above the respective mean summer temperatures (control, Delta +/- 0 degrees C) characteristic for each site. Survival and corresponding physiological and biochemical traits were analyzed. Vitality (optimum quantum yield, F-v/F-m) and growth were monitored over time and biochemical responses were measured at the end of the experiment. Growth was highest in northern and lowest in southern populations. Overall, northern populations from Spitsbergen, Bodo and Bergen were largely unaffected by increasing summer temperatures up to Delta+6 degrees C. Conversely, sporophytes from Helgoland and Locmariaquer were markedly stressed at Delta+6 degrees C: occurrence of tissue necrosis, reduced F-v/F-m, and a significantly elevated de-epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle (DPS). The variations in phlorotannins, mannitol and tissue C and N contents were independent of temperature treatments and latitudinal distribution pattern. Pronounced site-specific variability in response to increasing temperatures implies that exceeding a threshold above the mean summer temperature exclusively affect rear-edge (southernmost) populations.

AB  - Mangroves and lagoons are spawning and nursery grounds of marine fish. These ecosystems are increasingly exposed to episodes of extreme temperatures from marine heatwaves (MHWs). However, it is unknown how MHW effects may interact with those of predators to affect the fitness of prey species in these ecosystems. To address the issue, we exposed the calanoid copepod Pseudodiaptomus incisus to a simulated MHW and with/without the presence of fish predator cues (FPC). The size at maturity, clutch size, hatching success, lifetime nauplii and faecal pellet production, and the adult lifespan were determined. All fitness parameters of P. incisus were lower under MHW. Remarkably, nauplii production was reduced 80%, and adult lifespan was shortened 50%, respectively. Overall, FPC increased the size at maturity and hatching at both temperatures. FPC also increased clutch size, nauplii and faecal pellet production in the control temperature, but decreased all three parameters under MHW. These results suggest that FPC may increase the vulnerability of P. incisus to MHWs by lowering reproductive success and reducing grazing rate. Our study sheds light on how interactive effects between biotic and abiotic factors may shape the vulnerability of marine copepods in mangroves and lagoons of tropical regions.

AB  - High-mass protostars (M-star > 8M(circle dot)) are thought to gain the majority of their mass via short, intense bursts of growth. This episodic accretion is thought to be facilitated by gravitationally unstable and subsequently inhomogeneous accretion disks. Limitations of observational capabilities, paired with a lack of observed accretion burst events, have withheld affirmative confirmation of the association between disk accretion, instability and the accretion burst phenomenon in high-mass protostars. Following its 2019 accretion burst, a heatwave driven by a burst of radiation propagated outward from the high-mass protostar G358.93-0.03-MM1. Six very long baseline interferometry observations of the radiatively pumped 6.7 GHz methanol maser were conducted during this period, tracing ever increasing disk radii as the heatwave propagated outward. Concatenating the very long baseline interferometry maps provided a sparsely sampled, milliarcsecond view of the spatio-kinematics of the accretion disk covering a physical range of similar to 50-900 AU. We term this observational approach 'heatwave mapping'. We report the discovery of a Keplerian accretion disk with a spatially resolved four-arm spiral pattern around G358.93-0.03-MM1. This result positively implicates disk accretion and spiral arm instabilities into the episodic accretion high-mass star formation paradigm.

AB  - Ocean warming is killing corals, but heat-tolerant populations exist; if protected, they could replenish affected reefs naturally or through restoration. Palau's Rock Islands experience consistently higher temperatures and extreme heatwaves, yet their diverse coral communities bleach less than those on Palau's cooler outer reefs. Here, we combined genetic analyses, bleaching histories and growth rates of Porites cf. lobata colonies to identify thermally tolerant genotypes, map their distribution, and investigate potential growth trade-offs. We identified four genetic lineages of P. cf. lobata. On Palau's outer reefs, a thermally sensitive lineage dominates. The Rock Islands harbor two lineages with enhanced thermal tolerance; one of which shows no consistent growth trade-off and also occurs on several outer reefs. This suggests that the Rock Islands provide naturally tolerant larvae to neighboring areas. Finding and protecting such sources of thermally-tolerant corals is key to reef survival under 21(st) century climate change.

AB  - As a crucially-needed adaptation to climate change, the United Nations plans to expand Early Warning Systems (EWS) for extreme weather to cover everyone on Earth. Given the growing interest in this climate change adaptation solution, we assess how well weather early warnings perform for extreme events in different parts of the world. First, we carry out a forecast verification for weather forecasts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for 95th percentile extreme heat and extreme precipitation globally at 0.5 degrees resolution, with three days of lead time. We present the results alongside similar verification results from ECMWF forecasts and a CHIRPS-GEFS forecast, to identify regions of the world with consistent forecast skill. We then overlay the skill of these short-term weather forecasts on top of climate change projections for the increasing frequency of the extreme events themselves. Based on these results, we offer policy implications for EWS investments in different regions. We find that in much of the tropics, weather forecasts have relatively poor skill in forecasting extreme temperature and precipitation events, calling for further investments in predictability. In the extra-tropics, most extreme heat and extreme precipitation events can be correctly forecasted, with better results for multi-day events and shorter lead-times. While there is room to improve predictability, end-to-end investments in EWS in these regions can focus on the use of existing skillful forecasts. Finally, most of the world's land area is projected to see an increase in the magnitude of extreme heat and precipitation events with climate change, and EWS investments in these regions should prepare for unprecedented extremes and changing vulnerabilities. These results provide a foundation for localized research on EWS in different parts of the world as well as evidence for policy and donors on how best to invest in EWS in different regions.

AB  - Extreme temperatures from marine heatwaves may seriously affect the growth and immunity of aquaculture species and trigger disease outbreaks. Vitamin C supplements in the diets can improve the performance of farmed fish. However, it is unknown how extreme temperatures may alter the effects of dietary vitamin C on fish. To address the issues, we cultured juvenile Waigieu seaperch, Psammoperca waigiensis, with one of three dietary vitamin C levels (0, 100 and 400 mg/kg diet) and two temperatures (28 and 32 degrees C). We comprehensively assessed the growth, food utilization, immunity and pathogen resistance of P. waigiensis. Extreme temperature reduced survival, growth, feed utilization, protein and lipid contents, and immunological parameters. Fish fed with dietary vitamin C significantly improved growth, feed utilization, body protein, lipid contents, and haematological and immunological parameters in a dose-dependent manner. Vitamin C effects on these parameters were similar across two temperatures. Fish challenged with Streptococcus iniae showed faster mortality at 32 degrees C than at 28 degrees C. Fish fed with dietary vitamin C had lower mortality, especially at 28 degrees C. These results illustrate that extreme temperature weakened dietary vitamin C effect on the fish resistance to bacteria, challenging fish production under the increasing prevalence and severity of marine heatwaves.

AB  - Marine heatwave (MHW) is an extreme phenomenon of warm sea surface temperature anomaly that has a destructive impact on the marine ecosystem and organisms. This phenomenon increases every year in duration, frequency, and area due to the global warming. Almost all of the world's oceans have experienced MHW, including in the seas of the southern Java-Nusa Tenggara. The lack of detailed research in this area motivated us to analyze MHW drivers. MHW was identified with the 99th percentile method and duration of >= 5 days as a threshold by using blended product of SST data. In 2013, an MHW event was identified in the seas of the southern Java-Nusa Tenggara. This MHW lasts for 37 days, from 8 June to 14 July. The maximum (mean) intensity of sea surface temperature anomaly reaches 2.60 degrees C (1.83 degrees C) above climatology with an average area of 36.53 x 10(4) km(2). Locally, we found that probably the positive downward shortwave radiation affected this anomaly. Furthermore, a remote process of the propagation of downwelling Kelvin wave during negative Indian Ocean Dipole may also affect this anomaly. The strong westerly wind along the equatorial Indian ocean forms downwelling Kelvin wave that propagates to the southern Java-Nusa Tenggara increasing SST in this area.

AB  - Marine heatwaves (MHWs) have occurred with increasing duration, frequency and intensity in the past decade in the South China Sea, posing serious threats to marine ecosystems and fisheries. However, the impact of MHWs on marine bivalves - one of the most ecologically and economically important fauna in coastal ecosystems - remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated physiological responses of the pearl oyster, Pinctada maxima inhabiting a newly identified climate change hotspot (Beibu Gulf, South China Sea) to short-lasting and repeatedly-occurring MHWs scenarios. Following 3-day exposure to short-lasting MHWs scenarios with water temperature rapidly arising from 24 degrees C to 28 degrees C, 32 degrees C and 36 degrees C, respectively, mortality rates of pearl oysters increased, and especially they suffered 100% mortality at 36 degrees C. Activities of enzymes including acid phosphatase (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), glutathione (GSH) and level of malondialdehyde (MDA) increased significantly with increasing intensity and duration of MHWs, indicating thermal stress responses. When exposed to repeatedly-occurring MHWs scenarios, mortality rates of pearl oysters increased slightly, and thermal stress responses were alleviated, as exemplified by significant decreases in ACP, AKP, GSH and MDA activities compared with those during short-lasting MHWs scenarios, demonstrating the potential of P. maxima to acclimate rapidly to MHWs. These findings advance our understanding of how marine bivalves respond to MHWs scenarios varying in duration, frequency, and intensity.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of marine heatwaves (MHWs) in the Makassar Strait and adjacent waters (MSAW) using the Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISSTv2) dataset from 1982 to 2021. The analysis revealed a significant positive trend in the frequency and duration of MHWs, while the mean and maximum intensities displayed a negative trend over the 40-year period. By examining two different phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), it was observed that the cold phase (more frequent La Nina events than El Nino) had higher MHW frequency and duration, whereas the warm phase (more frequent El Nino events than La Nina) exhibited higher mean and maximum intensities. Moreover, the occurrence of high-intensity MHWs was associated with weakened winds, the decaying phase of El Nino and positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and high net surface heat flux (NSHF). An intriguing finding emerged, indicating a notable lag of 7-9 months (10 months) between El Nino (positive IOD) events and the emergence of high-intensity MHWs. This lag suggests that MHWs are more likely to manifest during the transition towards La Nina and negative IOD conditions. Additionally, the study highlighted a stronger correlation between the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and MHW intensity in the MSAW compared to the IOD. Furthermore, the different intensities of MHWs were found to be linked to NSHF, which exhibited higher values during the warm phase of the PDO compared to the cold phase.

AB  - The high-mass young stellar object G358.93-0.03-MM1 underwent a rapid accretion burst event from 2019 January to June, resulting in flares observed in most class II methanol maser transitions starting in mid-January. In contrast, the 22.235 GHz water maser flare started in mid-April. To investigate the physical origin of this significant difference, we made the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations toward the G358.93-0.03 region on 2019 March 23 and April 4 and obtained the intensity and spatial distribution images of the water maser as well as the continuum emissions at Ku and K bands on the epoch close to the water maser flare. A comparative analysis, incorporating previously reported detections in February (pre-water maser flare) and June (post-water maser flare), reveals the time lag between the accretion burst and water maser flare. These observations confirm the variations of the propagation speed of a heatwave induced by the accretion burst in different directions: the heatwave is decelerated in dense regions (e.g., the disk and jet), whereas in directions from G358-MM1 to water maser components, the heatwave speed is supposed to be close to the speed of light. Variations in flux density and spatial positions were detected for water masers and continuum emissions, indicating that the accretion burst event originating from G358-MM1 affects not only the immediate environment within a dense structure of 0.'' 2 (1400 au at a source distance of 6.75 kpc) around MM1 itself, but also exerts influence on broader-scale regions extending up to approximately 3 '' (21,000 au).

AB  - Urban green infrastructure, especially trees, are widely regarded as one of the most effective ways to reduce urban temperatures in heatwaves and alleviate the adverse impacts of extreme heat events on human health and well-being. Nevertheless, urban planners and decision-makers are still lacking methods and tools to spatially evaluate the cooling effects of urban green spaces and exploit them to assess greening strategies at the urban agglomeration scale. This article introduces a novel spatially explicit approach to simulate urban greening scenarios by increasing the tree canopy cover in the existing urban fabric and evaluating their heat mitigation potential. The latter is achieved by applying the InVEST urban cooling model to the synthetic land use/land cover maps generated for the greening scenarios. A case study in the urban agglomeration of Lausanne, Switzerland, illustrates the development of tree canopy scenarios following distinct spatial distribution strategies. The spatial pattern of the tree canopy strongly influences the human exposure to the highest temperatures, and small increases in the abundance of tree canopy cover with the appropriate spatial configuration can have major impacts on human health and well-being. The proposed approach supports urban planning and the design of nature-based solutions to enhance climate resilience.

AB  - Globally, observations on marine species during marine heatwaves (MHWs) help outline the scope of the MHW's possible biological effects. In line with this effort, this paper presents a 2020 MHW that coincided with a reported 'tomato jellyfish' (Crambione mastigophora Maas, 1903) bloom on 23 March 2020 in the Corong-Corong Bay of Palawan, Philippines. Detecting a moderate MHW from 21 March to 04 April 2020, the analysis of sea surface temperatures revealed that most areas surrounding the bloom site attained their peak positive anomalies on the same day as the reported bloom. Certain physical mechanisms present in the first quarter of 2020 may have played a role in the occurrence of both events: the presence of cyclonic eddies and parallel monsoonal winds alongshore can induce upwelling which promotes biological productivity in surface waters, while the observed weakening of winds have been associated with anomalous warming of the sea surface. Further studies are still highly recommended to determine the exact causes of the jellyfish bloom and what conditions make it more likely to happen during MHWs. However, if the C. mastigophora is hypothetically able to continually bloom amidst warming temperatures, the increasing trend of MHW frequency and intensity in the West Philippine Sea (where the reported bloom site is situated) may consequently yield more future co-occurrences. This paper aims to hopefully contribute to the existing knowledge of possible bio-logical impacts associated with extreme marine events, especially in the Philippine context where both jellyfish blooms and MHWs are understudied.

AB  - This study aims to investigate climate change's impact on health and adaptation in Vietnam through a systematic review and additional analyses of heat exposure, heat vulnerability, awareness and engagement, and projected health costs. Out of 127 reviewed studies, findings indicated the wider spread of infectious diseases, and increased mortality and hospitalisation risks associated with extreme heat, droughts, and floods. However, there are few studies addressing health cost, awareness, engagement, adaptation, and policy. Additional analyses showed rising heatwave exposure across Vietnam and global above-average vulnerability to heat. By 2050, climate change is projected to cost up to USD1-3B in healthcare costs, USD3-20B in premature deaths, and USD6-23B in work loss. Despite increased media focus on climate and health, a gap between public and government publications highlighted the need for more governmental engagement. Vietnam's climate policies have faced implementation challenges, including top-down approaches, lack of cooperation, low adaptive capacity, and limited resources.

AB  - Ongoing global warming is one of the major challenges for the development of aquaculture in the tropical regions where species are already cultured in the water temperature close to their upper physiological thresholds. Furthermore, warming can trigger blooms of toxic algae, yet we do not know how extreme warming such as a marine heatwave (MHW) and algal toxins may affect marine aquaculture species. To address this issue, we investigated the effects of a simulated MHW in combination with exposure to trans-4-trans-decadienal (PUA), a diatom-derived toxin, on survival, growth, development and biochemical composition of cobia larvae and juveniles. Cobia larvae were exposed for 48 hr to one of two temperatures (29 vs. 34 degrees C) and two PUA treatments (0 vs. 0.5 mu M). Surviving larvae from each treatment were divided into two subsets: three replicates were used for the feeding test and five replicates were used for the recovery test in a non-contaminated environment at the respective temperatures of 29 or 34 degrees C. Survival of cobia larvae was reduced by 16% in either MHW or PUA, but it dropped by 60% when both stressors were present, indicating a synergistic effect. MHW, but not PUA, reduced the feeding of cobia larvae. PUA had no delayed effects on growth rate and biochemical composition of the fish. MHW strongly reduced specific growth rate, body protein and lipid contents in cobia. Our results provide the first empirical evidence of how MHW and toxic algae may interact and challenge cobia and marine aquaculture production in tropical countries.

AB  - Human society and ecosystems are impacted by climate extremes more than by climate averages. In contrast with climate extremes that are driven by individual climatic variables, compound climate extremes stem from a combination of multiple climatic drivers and usually lead to more severe risks than the former extremes do. The influences of the drivers for compound climate extremes are strengthening under global warming. Firstly, this review details the development of the definition of compound climate extremes over recent years and describes different types of events, such as compound drought and heatwave extremes (CDHEs), compound day and night heat extremes (CDNHEs), and compound flooding (CF). Secondly, historical trends in compound climate ex-tremes in China over the past half-century, and projections of future trends under different scenarios, are dis-cussed. For example, this study points out that a large part of China has experienced longer, stronger, and more frequent CDHEs than other parts of the country. CDHEs have followed a significantly increasing trend since the 1990s, and this trend is projected to strengthen further under different scenarios in the future. Thirdly, this study reviews different potential causes for compound climate extremes, including the internal variability of the climate system (e.g., land and atmosphere feedbacks, large-scale circulation patterns) and external anthropo-genic forcings (e.g., urbanization and anthropogenic emissions). In this study, we summarize risks from different perspectives by considering interactions between hazards, vulnerability, and exposure. Many studies show that risks to infrastructural damage and population exposure are projected to increase in the future, and that crop yields and ecosystem gross primary production are likely to reduce. Finally, we generalize our study and show that there is an urgent need for a comprehensive study of different combinations of compound events. We argue that it is important that we understand the key dynamic and thermal processes that are modulated by specific drivers and investigate the uncertainty in the projected variabilities for compound climate extremes. This re-quires interdisciplinary collaboration and will allow appropriate risk adaptation strategies to be developed. There has been great progress in research into compound climate extremes; however, an improved understanding of the mechanisms and risks is necessary as a theoretical basis for more effective climate adaptation policies.

AB  - Background: Heat waves significantly impact ecosystems and human health, especially that of vulnerable populations, and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Besides being directly related to climate-sensitive health outcomes, heat waves have indirectly increased the burden on our health care systems. Although the existing literature examines the impact of heat waves and morbidity, past research has mostly been conducted in high-income countries (HICs), and studies on the impact of heat waves on morbidity in low-or middle-income countries (LMICs) are still scarce. Objective: This paper presents the protocol for a systematic review that aims to provide evidence of the impact of heat waves on health care services in LMICs.Methods: We will identify peer-reviewed studies from 3 online databases, including the Web of Science, PubMed, and SCOPUS, published from January 2002 to April 2023, using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Quality assessment will be conducted using the Navigation Guide checklist. Key search terms include heatwaves, extreme heat, hospitalization, outpatient visit, burden, health services, and morbidity.Results: This systematic review will provide insight into the impact of heat waves on health care services in LMICs, especially on emergency department visits, ambulance call-outs, hospital admissions, outpatient department visits, in-hospital mortality, and health care operational costs.Conclusions: The results of this review are anticipated to help policymakers and key stakeholders obtain a better understanding of the impact of heat waves on health care services and prioritize investments to mitigate the effects of heat waves in LMICs. This entails creating a comprehensive heat wave plan and ensuring that adequate infrastructure, capacity, and human resources are allocated in the health care sector. These measures will undoubtedly contribute to the development of resilience in health care systems and hence protect the health and well-being of individuals and communities.

AB  - Understanding the key variables that characterise fire propagation is important for a better estimation of fire events and their impacts. This study uses machine learning combined with satellite remote sensing and atmospheric modelled data to enhance estimations of burned areas. It focuses on the intense early summer weather patterns in South Asia during April and May 2022 and explores the relationship between environmental factors and fire spread. The study employs various algorithms, including random forest, extra trees, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), gradient boosting regressor, support vector regressor and neural networks. XGBoost proves to be the most accurate approach. An isolation forest algorithm is used to adjust for outliers in burned area estimations. The comprehensive analysis conducted includes the identification of key variables and sensitivity tests incorporating changes of up to 25 % in natural environmental conditions to assess the model's consistency. The results indicate that integrating vegetation, atmospheric, and human-related variables with the XGBoost algorithm, and incorporating outlier adjustments leads to the most effective performance (R2 >= 0.7), with jet stream variables enhancing the accuracy by approximately 11.5 %. The study highlights the notable impact on fire propagation of increases in the value of 300-hPa meridional circulation index flow (MCI300) and a high 500hPa geopotential height anomaly (Delta Z500), indicating the development of strong atmospheric blocking (upper tropospheric ridge). As compared to other factors, e.g. land surface temperature, vapour pressure deficit, soil moisture and vegetation optical depth, the impact of changes in jet stream metrics (MCI300 and Delta Z500) was more pronounced, indicating greater sensitivity. These insights emphasise the complexity of fire spread, and the importance of using atmospheric factors to estimate burned areas, particularly during severe heatwaves.

AB  - Marine Heatwaves (MHWs) are prolonged, discrete, and anomalously warm events, which have recently gained global attention due to their far-reaching effects and reported impacts. Although inten-sive studies have been carried out at global and regional scales, these events remained understudied in the Philippines - a country with high marine biodiversity. The Philippines is highly vulnerable to the impacts of these extreme events as it lies in the western boundary of the Pacific that is considered as a hotspot for MHWs. The present study used multi-year climatic sea surface temperature (SST) record to detect MHWs in the Philippines. The detected events were then characterized using the standardized metrics. Linear trend analysis was conducted to determine the magnitude and direction of the change of the MHW metrics over time. Decadal trend revealed that MHWs in the Philippines significantly increased from seven MHWs in the 1980s to 37 MHWs in the last decade. Moreover, increased duration was remarkable in 2020 with 276 MHW days. MHW frequency and duration were increasing at a rate almost twice as its neighboring waters. Intensities did not significantly increase with time, but the highest SST anomaly is associated with El Nino Southern Oscillation. Furthermore, the eastern and western region of the Philippines is vulnerable to MHWs, but hotspots are mostly confined in the West Philippine Sea and western tropical Pacific. An in-depth investigation of the drivers of MHWs is recommended to understand the physical mechanisms of the development of these extreme thermal events in the Philippine seas. The findings have significant implications for coastal marine resource management, highlighting the need for adaptive management strategies and increased monitoring and research efforts to mitigate the impacts of MHWs on marine ecosystems and local economies in the Philippines.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Adverse health effects from extreme heat remain a major risk, especially in a changing climate. Several European countries have implemented heat health action plans (HHAPs) to prevent ill health and excess mortality from heat. This paper assesses the state of implementation of HHAPs in the WHO European Region and discusses barriers and successes since the early 2000s. The results are based on a web-based survey among 53 member states on the current national and federal HHAPs in place. Guided by the eight core elements of HHAPs as outlined by the WHO Regional Office for Europe guidance from 2008, we analyzed which elements were fully or partially implemented and which areas of improvement countries identified. HHAP adaptations to account for COVID-19 were sought via literature search and expert consultations. 27 member states provided information, of which 17 countries reported having a HHAP. Five out of eight core elements, namely agreement on a lead body, accurate and timely alert systems, heat-related health information plans, strategies to reduce health exposure, and care for vulnerable groups, were at least partially implemented in all 17 plans. Alert systems were implemented most often at 94%. The least often implemented items were real-time surveillance, long-term urban planning, and preparedness of health and social systems. Five countries had published COVID-19 guidance online. Our findings suggest a progressive improvement in the development and rollout of HHAPs overall and awareness of vulnerable population groups in WHO/Europe, while integration of HHAPs into long-term climate change and health planning remains a challenge.

AB  - We present unprecedented datasets of current and future projected weather files for building simulations in 15 major cities distributed across 10 climate zones worldwide. The datasets include ambient air temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, direct and diffuse solar irradiance, and wind speed at hourly resolution, which are essential climate elements needed to undertake building simulations. The datasets contain typical and extreme weather years in the EnergyPlus weather file (EPW) format and multiyear projections in comma-separated value (CSV) format for three periods: historical (2001-2020), future mid-term (2041-2060), and future long-term (2081-2100). The datasets were generated from projections of one regional climate model, which were bias-corrected using multiyear observational data for each city. The methodology used makes the datasets among the first to incorporate complex changes in the future climate for the frequency, duration, and magnitude of extreme temperatures. These datasets, created within the IEA EBC Annex 80 "Resilient Cooling for Buildings", are ready to be used for different types of building adaptation and resilience studies to climate change and heatwaves.

AB  - Extreme heat is an increasing climate threat, most pronounced in urban areas where poor populations are at particular risk. We analyzed heat impacts and vulnerabilities of 1027 outdoor workers who participated in a KAP survey in Hanoi, Vietnam in 2018, and the influence of their mitigation actions, their knowledge of heat-risks, and access to early warnings. We grouped respondents by their main income (vendors, builders, shippers, others, multiple jobs, and nonworking) and analyzed their reported heat-health impacts, taking into consideration socioeconomics, knowledge of heat impacts and preventive measures, actions taken, access to air-conditioning, drinking amounts and use of weather forecasts. We applied linear and logistic regression analyses using R. Construction workers were younger and had less knowledge of heat-health impacts, but also reported fewer symptoms. Older females were more likely to report symptoms and visit a doctor. Access to air-conditioning in the bedroom depended on age and house ownership, but did not influence heat impacts as cooling was too expensive. Respondents who knew more heat exhaustion symptoms were more likely to report impacts (p < 0.01) or consult a doctor (p < 0.05). Similarly, those who checked weather updates were more likely to report heat impacts (p < 0.01) and experienced about 0.6 more symptoms (p < 0.01). Even though occupation type did not explain heat illness, builders knew considerably less (40%; p < 0.05) about heat than other groups but were twice as likely to consult a doctor than street vendors (p < 0.01). Knowledge of preventive actions and taking these actions both correlated positively with reporting of heat-health symptoms, while drinking water did not reduce these symptoms (p < 0.01). Child carers and homeowners experienced income losses in heatwaves (p < 0.01). The differences support directed actions, such as dissemination of educational materials and weather forecasts for construction workers. The Red Cross assisted all groups with cooling tents, provision of drinks and health advice. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Climate change is a major threat to global food security. Changes in climate can directly impact food systems by reducing the production and genetic diversity of crops and their wild relatives, thereby restricting future options for breeding improved varieties and reducing the ability to adapt crops to future challenges. The global surface temperature is predicted to rise by an average of 0.3 degrees C during the next decade, and the Paris Agreement (Paris Climate Accords) aims to limit global warming to below an average of 2 degrees C, preferably to 1.5 degrees C compared to pre-industrial levels. Even if the goal of the Paris Agreement can be met, the predicted rise in temperatures will increase the likelihood of extreme weather events, including heatwaves, making heat stress (HS) a major global abiotic stress factor for many crops. HS can have adverse effects on plant morphology, physiology, and biochemistry during all stages of vegetative and reproductive development. In fruiting vegetables, even moderate HS reduces fruit set and yields, and high temperatures may result in poor fruit quality. In this review, we emphasize the effects of abiotic stress, especially at high temperatures, on crop plants, such as tomatoes, touching upon key processes determining plant growth and yield. Specifically, we investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in HS tolerance and the challenges of developing heat-tolerant tomato varieties. Finally, we discuss a strategy for effectively improving the heat tolerance of vegetable crops.

AB  - Background: Heat waves caused by climate change are increasingly challenging the wellbeing of individuals across the lifespan. Current efforts to understand the thermal perceptions and behaviours of people throughout the lifespan during heat waves are limited.Methods: Since June 2021, the Active Heatwave project has been recruiting households to better understand how individuals perceive, cope, and behave during heat waves. Using our novel web platform, participants were prompted to answer our Heat Alert Survey on days when a participants geolocation corresponded to a broadcasted local heat alert. Participants provided 24-h movement behaviour, thirst, thermal perception, and cooling strategies via validated questionnaires.Results: A total of 285 participants (118 children) from 60 distinct weather station locations globally participated between June and September 2021 and 2022. At least 1 heat alert (834 total) were identified from 95% (57/60) of the weather stations. Children reported spending more time performing vigorous intensity exercise compared to adults (p < 0.05), but no differences in thermal sensation, thermal comfort, or thirst sensation (all p > 0.31) were observed. For thirst management, 88% of respondents used water to relieve thirst, although notably, 15% of adults reported using alcohol. Regardless of age, staying indoors was the most common heat management strategy, whereas visiting cooling centres was the least.Conclusion: The present study presents a proof-of-concept combining local heat alert notifications with e-questionnaires for collecting near-real-time perceptual and behavioural data for both children and adults during heat waves. The observed patterns of behaviour suggest that present public heat-health guidelines are often ignored, children engage in fewer heat management strategies compared to adults, and these disparities highlight the need to improve public health communication and knowledge dissemination around promoting effective and accessible cooling solutions for children and adults.

AB  - Artificial light pollution and climate change are two important threats to the coastal ecosystems worldwide. However, the potential interaction of artificial light and extreme warming on coastal species is unknown. To address this issue, we exposed a tropical copepod Pseudodiaptomus incisus to one of twelve combinations of four photoperiods (0L:24D, 12L:12D, 18L:6D and 24L:0D - light: dark cycle) and three temperatures (26, 30 and 34 degrees C). We quantified five key productivity parameters, including development time, body size of all 12 development stages, clutch size, hatching success and nauplii production. P. incisus had a larger body size and clutch size and higher nauplii production at the photoperiod of 12L:12D and 18L:6D than in continuous lighting condition (24L:0D). Copepods developed faster but showed smaller body size, clutch size, hatching success and nauplii production at 34 degrees C than at 30 and 26 degrees C. Importantly, continuous lighting resulted in stronger reductions in body size, clutch size, hatching success and nauplii production at 34 degrees C. Our results suggest that continuous lighting may increase the vulnerability of coastal zooplankton to climate change with ecological consequences. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The range-expansion of tropical herbivores due to ocean warming can profoundly alter temperate reef communities by overgrazing the seaweed forests that underpin them. Such ecological interactions may be mediated by changes to seaweed-associated microbiota in response to warming, but empirical evidence demonstrating this is rare. We experimentally simulated ocean warming and marine heatwaves (MHWs) to quantify effects on two dominant temperate seaweed species and their microbiota, as well as grazing by a tropical herbivore. The kelp Ecklonia radiata's microbiota in sustained warming and MHW treatments was enriched with microorganisms associated with seaweed disease and tissue degradation. In contrast, the fucoid Sargassum linearifolium's microbiota was unaffected by temperature. Consumption by the tropical sea-urchin Tripneustes gratilla was greater on Ecklonia where the microbiota had been altered by higher temperatures, while Sargassum's consumption was unaffected. Elemental traits (carbon, nitrogen), chemical defences (phenolics) and tissue bleaching of both seaweeds were generally unaffected by temperature. Effects of warming and MHWs on seaweed holobionts (host plus its microbiota) are likely species-specific. The effect of increased temperature on Ecklonia's microbiota and subsequent increased consumption suggest that changes to kelp microbiota may underpin kelp-herbivore interactions, providing novel insights into potential mechanisms driving change in species' interactions in warming oceans.

AB  - We conducted an investigation into the characteristics of marine heatwaves (MHWs) in Indonesian waters, aiming to understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for their formation, particularly the ones generated by net surface heat flux. To accomplish this, we utilized remote sensing data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The dataset covered a 40-year period (1982-2021) encompassing both warm (1982-2007) and cold (2008-2021) phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Statistical analysis methods were employed to process the data. Our study reveals significant findings regarding MHWs in Indonesian waters. We observed the highest average frequency and maximum intensity of MHWs, occurring approximately 2-3 times a year and exceeding 1.5 & DEG;C, respectively, during the warm phase of PDO (with El Nino events occurring more frequently than La Nina). Conversely, the longest durations of MHWs in Indonesian waters were recorded during the cold phase of PDO (with La Nina events occurring more frequently than El Nino), spanning approximately 7-15 days. We identified local forcing in the form of net surface heat flux as the primary driver of MHW frequency and maximum intensity. During the warm phase of PDO, the net surface heat flux was notably higher, primarily due to increased shortwave radiation (heat gain) and reduced latent heat flux (heat loss) through the evaporation process. These factors collectively contributed to maintaining warmer ocean temperatures. Moreover, our study provides valuable insights into the interannual variability of MHWs through the application of composite calculations. We discovered a strong correlation between the occurrence of El Nino and positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) events during the warm PDO phase and the highest frequency and maximum intensity of MHWs, with approximately 2.52 events and 1.54 & DEG;C, respectively. In contrast, we found that MHWs with the longest durations were closely linked to La Nina and negative IOD events during the cold PDO phase, lasting approximately 10.90 days. These findings highlight the complex interplay between climate phenomena and MHW characteristics, further deepening our understanding of their dynamics.

AB  - For the 40 years after the end of commercial whaling in 1976, humpback whale populations in the North Pacific Ocean exhibited a prolonged period of recovery. Using mark-recapture methods on the largest individual photo-identification dataset ever assembled for a cetacean, we estimated annual ocean-basin-wide abundance for the species from 2002 through 2021. Trends in annual estimates describe strong post-whaling era population recovery from 16 875 (+/- 5955) in 2002 to a peak abundance estimate of 33 488 (+/- 4455) in 2012. An apparent 20% decline from 2012 to 2021, 33 488 (+/- 4455) to 26 662 (+/- 4192), suggests the population abruptly reached carrying capacity due to loss of prey resources. This was particularly evident for humpback whales wintering in Hawai'i, where, by 2021, estimated abundance had declined by 34% from a peak in 2013, down to abundance levels previously seen in 2006, and contrasted to an absence of decline in Mainland Mexico breeding humpbacks. The strongest marine heatwave recorded globally to date during the 2014-2016 period appeared to have altered the course of species recovery, with enduring effects. Extending this time series will allow humpback whales to serve as an indicator species for the ecosystem in the face of a changing climate.

AB  - The interaction and the interplay of climate change with oil palm production in the Southeast Asia region are of serious concern. This particularly applies in Malaysia due to its rank as the second largest palm oil producer in the world. The anthropogenic activities and the agroecological practices in oil palm plantation, including excessive use of fertilisers, bush fire due to land clearing, and cultivation on peatland, have exacerbated the effects of climate change featuring extreme events, drought, flooding, heatwave, as well as infestation of pest and diseases. These adverse impacts on oil palm production highlight the significance of deploying effective adaptation strategies. The study aims to examine the impact of climate change on oil palm production and identify the farmers' adaptation strategies to the impacts of climate change in Malaysia. This study was conducted a comprehensive review of the articles published from 2000 to 2021 in the contexts of climate change and oil palm production in Malaysia. The review shows that climate change has a range of impacts on the oil palm production in Malaysia. As a result, several adaptation options were identified, such as breeding of hybrid varieties that are tolerant and resistant to heat; sustainable management of soil; pit and tranches to enhance water management in plantation areas; minimal use of fertilisers, herbicides, and pesticides; zero burning; and minimum tillage. The reviewed studies recommended the following to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change: sustainable national policy on climate change, conservation of the existing carbon stock, effective management of tropical rainforest biodiversity, afforestation for carbon sequestration, and reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission.

AB  - The eucheumatoidsKappaphycusandEucheumaare cultivated in tropical or subtropical regions for the production of carrageenan, a hydrocolloid widely used in the food and cosmetic industries.Kappaphycus alvareziiis a highly valued economic crop in the Coral Triangle, with the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia ranked among the largest producers. In the absence of measures to mitigate climate change, extreme events including heatwaves, typhoons, severe El Nino and La Nina, are expected to increase in frequency and magnitude. This inadvertently brings adverse effects to the seaweed cultivation industry, especially in the tropics. Temperatures are rapidly reaching the upper limit of biologically tolerable levels and an increase in reports ofice-iceand pest outbreaks is attributable to these shifts of environmental parameters. Nevertheless, few reports on the response of eucheumatoids to a changing environment, in particular global warming, are available. Understanding the responses and possible mechanisms for acclimation to warming is crucial for a sustainable seaweed cultivation industry. Here, the physiological and biochemical responses ofK.alvareziito acute warming indicated that the strain used in the current study is unlikely to survive sudden increases in temperature above 36 degrees C. As temperature increased, the growth rates, photosynthetic performance, phycocolloid quality (carrageenan yield, gel strength and gel viscosity) and pigment content (chlorophyll-a, carotenoid and phycobiliproteins) were reduced while the production of reactive oxygen species increased indicating the occurrence of stress in the seaweeds. This study provides a basis for future work on long term acclimation to elevated temperature and mesocosm-based multivariate studies to identify heat-tolerant strains for sustainable cultivation.

AB  - Climate change-related events, such as marine heatwaves, are increasing seawater temperatures, thereby putting pressure on marine biota. The cosmopolitan distribution and significant contribution to marine primary production by the genus Ruppia makes them interesting organisms to study thermal tolerance and local adaptation. In this study, we investigated the photosynthetic responses in Ruppia to the predicted future warming in two contrasting bioregions, temperate Sweden and tropical Thailand. Through DNA barcoding, specimens were determined to Ruppia cirrhosa for Sweden and Ruppia maritima for Thailand. Photosynthetic responses were assessed using pulse amplitude-modulated fluorometry, firstly in short time incubations at 18, 23, 28, and 33 degrees C in the Swedish set-up and 28, 33, 38, and 43 degrees C in the Thai set-up. Subsequent experiments were conducted to compare the short time effects to longer, five-day incubations in 28 degrees C for Swedish plants and 40 degrees C for Thai plants. Swedish R. cirrhosa displayed minor response, while Thai R. maritima was more sensitive to both direct and prolonged temperature stress with a drastic decrease in the photosynthetic parameters leading to mortality. The results indicate that in predicted warming scenarios, Swedish R. cirrhosa may sustain an efficient photosynthesis and potentially outcompete more heat-sensitive species. However, populations of the similar R. maritima in tropical environments may suffer a decline as their productivity will be highly reduced.

AB  - Marine foundation species are the biotic basis for many of the world's coastal ecosystems, providing structural habitat, food, and protection for myriad plants and animals as well as many ecosystem services. However, climate change poses a significant threat to foundation species and the ecosystems they support.We review the impacts of climate change on common marine foundation species, including corals, kelps, seagrasses, salt marsh plants, mangroves, and bivalves. It is evident that marine foundation species have already been severely impacted by several climate change drivers, often through interactive effects with other human stressors, such as pollution, overfishing, and coastal development. Despite considerable variation in geographical, environmental, and ecological contexts, direct and indirect effects of gradual warming and subsequent heatwaves have emerged as the most pervasive drivers of observed impact and potent threat across all marine foundation species, but effects from sea level rise, ocean acidification, and increased storminess are expected to increase. Documented impacts include changes in the genetic structures, physiology, abundance, and distribution of the foundation species themselves and changes to their interactions with other species, with flow-on effects to associated communities, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning.We discuss strategies to support marine foundation species into the Anthropocene, in order to increase their resilience and ensure the persistence of the ecosystem services they provide.

AB  - Purpose The interconnections between climate change and health are well studied. However, there is a perceived need for studies that examine how responses to health hazards (e.g. cardiovascular diseases, ozone layer effects, allergens, mental health and vector-borne diseases) may assist in reducing their impacts. The purpose of this paper is to review the evidence on health responses to climate hazards and list some measures to address them. Design/methodology/approach A mixed literature review, bibliometric analysis and an original online survey were undertaken on 140 participants from 55 countries spread across all geographical regions. Findings The bibliometric analysis identified that most climate-related health hazards are associated with extreme weather events. However, only one-third of the investigated papers specifically analysed the connections between climate change and health hazards, revealing a thematic gap. Also, although Africa is highly affected by climate change, only 5% of the assessed studies focused on this continent. Many respondents to the survey indicated "heat distress" as a significant vulnerability. The survey also identified social determinants relevant to climate-induced health vulnerabilities, such as socioeconomic and environmental factors, infrastructure and pre-existing health conditions. Most respondents agree that policies and regulations are the most effective adaptation tools to address the public health hazards triggered by climate change. This paper presents some suggestions for optimising public health responses to health hazards associated with climate change, such as the inclusion of climate-related components in public health policies, setting up monitoring systems to assess the extent to which specific climate events may pose a health threat, establishing plans to cope with the health implications of heatwaves, increased measures to protect vulnerable groups and education and awareness-raising initiatives to reduce the overall vulnerability of the population to climate-related health hazards. These measures may assist the ongoing global efforts to understand better - and cope with - the impacts of climate change on health. Originality/value The combination of a literature review, bibliometric analysis and an original world survey identified and presented a wide range of responses.

AB  - Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are emerging as a severe stressor in marine ecosystems. Extreme warm sea surface temperatures during MHWs often exceed the optimal thermal range for more than one generation of tropical coastal zooplankton. However, it is relatively unknown whether transgenerational plasticity (TGP) to MHWs may shape the offspring's fitness, particularly in an ecologically relevant context with biotic interactions such as predation stress. We addressed these novel research questions by determining the survival, reproductive success, and grazing rate of the copepod Pseudodiaptomus incisus exposed to MHW and fish predator cues (FPC) for two generations (F1 and F2). The experiment was designed in a full orthogonal manner with 4 treatments in F1 and 16 treatments in F2 generation. In both generations, MHW reduced P. incisus survival, reproductive parameters, and grazing by 10%-62% in MHW, but these parameters increased by 2%-15% with exposure to FPC, particularly at control temperature. F2 reproductive success and grazing rate as indicated by cumulative fecal pellets were reduced by 20%-30% in F1-MHW, but increased by similar to 2% in F1-FPC. Strikingly, MHW exposure reduced 17%-18% survival, but transgenerational exposure to MHWs fully ameliorated its lethal effect and this transgenerational effect was independent of FPC. Increased survival came with a cost of reduced reproductive success, constrained by reduced grazing. The rapid transgenerational MHW acclimation and its associated costs are likely widespread and crucial mechanisms underlying the resilience of coastal tropical zooplankton to MHWs in tropical coastal marine ecosystems.

AB  - Marine heatwaves (MHWs), discrete periods of extreme warm water temperatures superimposed onto persistent ocean warming, have increased in frequency and significantly disrupted marine ecosystems. While field observations on the ecological consequences of MHWs are growing, a mechanistic understanding of their direct effects is rare. We conducted an outdoor tank experiment testing how different thermal stressor profiles impacted the ecophysiological performance of three dominant forest-forming seaweeds. Four thermal scenarios were tested: contemporary summer temperature (22 degrees C), low persistent warming (24 degrees C), a discrete MHW (22-27 degrees C), and temperature variability followed by a MHW (22-24 degrees C, 22-27 degrees C). The physiological performance of seaweeds was strongly related to thermal profile and varied among species, with the highest temperature not always having the strongest effect. MHWs were highly detrimental for the fucoid Phyllospora comosa, whereas the laminarian kelp Ecklonia radiata showed sensitivity to extended thermal stress and demonstrated a cumulative temperature threshold. The fucoid Sargassum linearifolium showed resilience, albeit with signs of decline with bleached and degraded fronds, under all conditions, with stronger decline under stable control and warming conditions. The varying responses of these three co-occurring forest-forming seaweeds under different temperature scenarios suggests that the impact of ocean warming on near shore ecosystems may be complex and will depend on the specific thermal profile of rising water temperatures relative to the vulnerability of different species.

AB  - The severe heatwaves and hot spells in Vietnam were observed more frequently in intensity and duration due to global warming and climate change impacts. The hot days and extreme summer events make the weather harsh and significantly affect human health and the environment. This study presents the spatiotemporal distribution of the number of hot days (NHDs) in Vietnam. The variability of NHD in seven climate subregions is also examined in association with the large-scale drivers. The European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis version 5 (ERA5) data for the period 1981-2020 are used. Principal component analysis is also applied to the observed monthly NHD to obtain spatial patterns and time series. The results show that the NHD in the Highland and South subregions from March to May is linked with the subtropical high associated with decreased 500hPa-level vertical velocity (VV500). From May to June, the North and Central subregions seem related to deepening the Asiatic low and enhancement of southwest flows across the Indochina Peninsula. Finally, both increased southwest flows and decreased VV500 can partly contribute to the intensification of NHD in the North and Central subregions during July and August. The long trends of NHD are also examined. The results reveal that the increasing trends in NHD occur in most subregions, except for the Central Highland, and changing trends of NHD in June greatly contribute to the annual trend of NHD. Finally, the examinations with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation events show that NHD is significantly higher in El Nino events than in La Nina events in March and April for the Northwest, South Central, Central Highlands, and South, in May and June for all subregions, and in July and August for only the Red River Delta subregion. This suggests that ENSO can provide the potential for improving seasonal climate forecasts and mitigating natural disaster risks for the community.

AB  - Energy demand fluctuations due to low probability high impact (LPHI) micro-climatic events such as urban heat island effect (UHI) and heatwaves, pose significant challenges for urban infrastructure, particularly within urban built-clusters. Mapping short term load forecasting (STLF) of buildings in urban micro-climatic setting (UMS) is obscured by the complex interplay of surrounding morphology, micro-climate and inter-building energy dynamics. Conventional urban building energy modelling (UBEM) approaches to provide quantitative insights about building energy consumption often neglect the synergistic impacts of micro-climate and urban morphology in short temporal scale. Reduced order modelling, unavailability of rich urban datasets such as building key performance indicators for building archetypes-characterization, limit the inter-building energy dynamics consideration into UBEMs. In addition, mismatch of resolutions of spatio-temporal datasets (meso to micro scale transition), LPHI events extent prediction around UMS as well as its accurate quantitative inclusion in UBEM input organization step pose another degree of limitations. This review aims to direct attention towards an integrated-UBEM (i-UBEM) framework to capture the building load fluctuation over multi-scale spatio-temporal scenario. It highlights usage of emerging data-driven hybrid approaches, after systematically analysing developments and limitations of recent physical, data-driven artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI-ML) based modelling approaches. It also discusses the potential integration of google earth engine (GEE)-cloud computing platform in UBEM input organization step to (i) map the land surface temperature (LST) data (quantitative attribute implying LPHI event occurrence), (ii) manage and pre-process high-resolution spatio-temporal UBEM input-datasets. Further the potential of digital twin, central structed data models to integrate along UBEM workflow to reduce uncertainties related to building archetype characterizations is explored. It has also found that a trade-off between high-fidelity baseline simulation models and computationally efficient platform support or co-simulation platform integration is essential to capture LPHI induced inter-building energy dynamics.

AB  - Marine sponges are prominent organisms of the benthic coral reef fauna, providing important ecosystem services. While there have been increasing reports that sponges are becoming one of the dominant benthic organisms in some locations and ecoregions (e.g. Caribbean), they can be impacted by changing environmental conditions. This study presents the first documentation of a mass mortality event of the barrel sponge Xestospongia sp. in the lower Gulf of Thailand and its consequences on population dynamics and size distribution. Two anthropogenic impacted reefs (Haad Khom and Mae Haad) of the island Koh Phangan and two anthropogenic non-impacted reefs of the islands Koh Yippon and Hin Yippon within the Mu Ko Ang Thong Marine National Park were surveyed in the years 2015 and 2016. The results showed a strong shift in population densities at Koh Phangan. Fatal "bleaching" ending up in mass mortality was observed for these reefs in 2015. Xestospongia sp. abundance decreased from 2015 to 2016 by 80.6% at Haad Khom and by 98.4% at Mae Haad. Sponges of all sizes were affected, and mortality occurred regardless of the survey depth (4 and 6 m). However, Xestospongia population densities in the Marine Park were at a constant level during the surveys. The abundances in 2015 were 65% higher at the Marine Park than at Koh Phangan and 92% higher in 2016. The most likely causes of the mass mortality event was a local harmful algal bloom event, pathogens, undetected local higher water temperatures, or a combination of these factors, whereas sea surface temperature analyses showed no marine heatwave during the observed mass mortality event in 2015. Considering the ecological importance of sponges such as Xestospongia sp., long-term monitoring of reefs and their environmental parameters should be implemented to prevent such mass die-offs.

AB  - To understand the thermal plasticity of a coastal foundation species across its latitudinal distribution, we assess physiological responses to high temperature stress in the kelpLaminaria digitatain combination with population genetic characteristics and relate heat resilience to genetic features and phylogeography. We hypothesize that populations from Arctic and cold-temperate locations are less heat resilient than populations from warm distributional edges. Using meristems of naturalL. digitatapopulations from six locations ranging between Kongsfjorden, Spitsbergen (79 degrees N), and Quiberon, France (47 degrees N), we performed a common-garden heat stress experiment applying 15 degrees C to 23 degrees C over eight days. We assessed growth, photosynthetic quantum yield, carbon and nitrogen storage, and xanthophyll pigment contents as response traits. Population connectivity and genetic diversity were analyzed with microsatellite markers. Results from the heat stress experiment suggest that the upper temperature limit ofL. digitatais nearly identical across its distribution range, but subtle differences in growth and stress responses were revealed for three populations from the species' ecological range margins. Two populations at the species' warm distribution limit showed higher temperature tolerance compared to other populations in growth at 19 degrees C and recovery from 21 degrees C (Quiberon, France), and photosynthetic quantum yield and xanthophyll pigment responses at 23 degrees C (Helgoland, Germany). InL. digitatafrom the northernmost population (Spitsbergen, Norway), quantum yield indicated the highest heat sensitivity. Microsatellite genotyping revealed all sampled populations to be genetically distinct, with a strong hierarchical structure between southern and northern clades. Genetic diversity was lowest in the isolated population of the North Sea island of Helgoland and highest in Roscoff in the English Channel. All together, these results support the hypothesis of moderate local differentiation acrossL. digitata'sEuropean distribution, whereas effects are likely too weak to ameliorate the species' capacity to withstand ocean warming and marine heatwaves at the southern range edge.

AB  - Introduction Ocean temperatures have been consistently increasing due to climate change, and the frequency of heatwave events on shellfish quality is a growing concern worldwide. Typically, shellfish growing areas are in remote or difficult to access locations which makes in-field sampling and sample preservation of shellfish heat stress difficult. As such, there is a need to investigate in-field sampling approaches that facilitate the study of heat stress in shellfish. Objectives This study aims to apply a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) based metabolomics approach to examine molecular mechanisms of heat stress responses in shellfish using abalone as a model, and compare the effects of different quenching protocols on abalone metabolic profiles. Methods Twenty adult Haliotis iris abalone were exposed to two temperatures (14 degrees C and 24 degrees C) for 24 h. Then, haemolymph and muscle tissues of each animal were sampled and quenched with 4 different protocols (liquid nitrogen, dry ice, cold methanol solution and normal ice) which were analyzed via GC-MS for central carbon metabolites. Results The effects of different quenching protocols were only observed in muscle tissues in which the cold methanol solution and normal ice caused some changes in the observed metabolic profiles, compared to dry ice and liquid nitrogen. Abalone muscle tissues were less affected by thermal stress than haemolymph. There were 10 and 46 compounds significantly influenced by thermal stress in muscle and haemolymph, respectively. The changes of these metabolite signatures indicate oxidative damage, disturbance of amino acid and fatty acid metabolism, and a shift from aerobic metabolism to anaerobic pathways. Conclusions The study provided insights into the heat response of abalone, which could be useful for understanding the effects of marine heatwaves and summer mortality events on abalone. Dry ice appeared to be a suitable protocol, and safer in-field alternative to liquid nitrogen, for quenching of abalone tissues.

AB  - In the context of increasing urbanization and climate change globally, urban energy systems (UES) planning needs adequate consideration of climate change, particularly to ensure energy supply during extreme weather events (EWE) such as heatwaves, floods, and typhoons. Here we propose a two-layer modeling framework for UES planning considering the impact of EWE. An application of the framework to a typical coastal city of Xiamen, China reveals that deploying energy storage (i.e., pumped hydro and battery) offers significant flexibility to ensure the critical demand is met during typhoon as a typical EWE and avoids over investment in supply technologies. This requires an extra 2.8% total cost on investment and operation of UES for 20 years. Planning energy systems with proper consideration of EWE can ensure robust urban energy services even with increasing penetration of fluctuating renewables, and we offer a flexible and computationally efficient paradigm for UES planning considering the impact of EWE.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NBS) are increasingly at the centre of urban strategies to mitigate heatwaves and flooding, improve public health and restore biodiversity. However, on-ground implementation has been slow, inconsistent and often limited to demonstration sites. A broad literature consistently highlights institutional barriers as a major reason for the observed implementation gap. In this study, we developed and deployed an assessment tool to identify barriers to NBS delivery on a European Commission Horizon 2020 project spanning seven cities. We found that practitioners were effectively navigating challenges in the areas where they had significant control, including community engagement, strategy development and technical skills. The greatest barriers were outside the influence of project teams: understaffing, a lack of intra-organisational processes, and risk-averse organisational cultures. These findings emphasise that after cities embrace NBS at the strategic and political level, it is vital that executives follow through with the necessary pragmatic reforms to enable delivery.

AB  - Extreme events, such as those caused by climate change, economic or geopolitical shocks, and pest or dis-ease epidemics, threaten global food security. The complexity of causation, as well as the myriad ways thatan event, or a sequence of events, creates cascading and systemic impacts, poses significant challenges tofood systems research and policy alike. To identify priority food security risks and research opportunities, weasked experts from a range of fields and geographies to describe key threats to global food security over thenext two decades and to suggest key research questions and gaps on this topic. Here, we present a priori-tization of threats to global food security from extreme events, as well as emerging research questions thathighlight the conceptual and practical challenges that exist in designing, adopting, and governing resilientfood systems. We hope that these findings help in directing research funding and resources toward food sys-tem transformations needed to help society tackle major food system risks and food insecurity underextreme events.

AB  - Extreme temperature events have occurred in all ocean basins in the past two decades with detrimental impacts on marine biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and services. However, global impacts of temperature extremes on fish stocks, fisheries, and dependent people have not been quantified. Using an integrated climate-biodiversity-fisheries-economic impact model, we project that, on average, when an annual high temperature extreme occurs in an exclusive economic zone, 77% of exploited fishes and invertebrates therein will decrease in biomass while maximum catch potential will drop by 6%, adding to the decadal-scale mean impacts under climate change. The net negative impacts of high temperature extremes on fish stocks are projected to cause losses in fisheries revenues and livelihoods in most maritime countries, creating shocks to fisheries social-ecological systems particularly in climate-vulnerable areas. Our study highlights the need for rapid adaptation responses to extreme temperatures in addition to carbon mitigation to support sustainable ocean development.

AB  - IntroductionExtreme heat causes a major health burden, especially for older Australians.ObjectiveTo assess the impact of extreme heat on older regional and rural Australians, including clinical presentations, social implications, and health-seeking behaviours and adaptations.DesignA systematic review and narrative synthesis.FindingsTen articles were included in the review with research on this topic limited. Extreme heat causes an increase in mortality and ambulance dispatches for older rural Australians. Social connectedness is negatively affected by extreme heat due to cancellation of events and individuals becoming housebound. Air conditioning is the main cooling mechanism used, although cost is a major concern. Despite this, older rural populations display a depth of knowledge regarding practical behavioural responses to adapt to extreme heat. Studies show older rural Australians do not consider extreme heat to be a threat to health.DiscussionFurther research needs to examine the role extreme heat may play in contributing to experiences of loneliness. Air conditioning cannot be the ultimate solution in responding to extreme heat due to cost and increased carbon emissions. The low-risk perception of extreme heat for older rural people may inform effective heat health warnings and effective use of primary health care in heat-health education. Listening to First Nations knowledge in dealing with heat may provide a powerful mechanism in which to protect health.ConclusionThe extensive health effects of extreme heat highlights the necessity of further research and strengthening of services in preparation for an ageing rural population enduring climate change.

AB  - Under global warming, a novel category of extreme events has become increasingly apparent, where flood and hot extremes occur in rapid succession, causing significant damages to infrastructure and ecosystems. However, these bivariate compound flood-hot extreme (CFH) hazards have not been comprehensively examined at the global scale, and their evolution under climate warming remains unstudied. Here, we present the first global picture of projected changes in CFH hazards by using a cascade modeling chain of CMIP6 models, satellite and reanalysis data sets, bias correction, and hydrological models. We find an increasing percentage of floods will be accompanied by hot extremes under climate change; the joint return periods of CFHs are projected to decrease globally, particularly in the tropics. These decreasing joint return periods are largely driven by changes in hot extremes and indicate a likely increase of CFH hazards, and ultimately highlight the urgent need to conduct adaptation planning for future risks.

AB  - Background: understanding the effects of coexposure to compound extreme events, such as air pollution and extreme heat, is important for reducing current and future health burdens. This study investigated the independent and synergistic effects of exposure to air pollution from vegetation fires and extreme heat on all-cause mortality in Upper Northern Thailand. Methods: we used a time-stratified case-crossover study design with a conditional quasi-Poisson model to examine the association between mortality and coexposure to air pollution due to vegetation fire events (fire-PM2.5) and extreme heat. Extreme heat days were defined using the 90th and 99th percentile thresholds for daily maximum temperature. Results: we observed a significant positive excess risk of mortality due to independent exposure to fire-PM2.5 and extreme heat, but not an interactive effect. All-cause mortality risk increased by 0.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.1, 1.8) for each 10 mu g/m(3) increase in fire-PM2.5 on the same day and by 12.8% (95% CI: 10.5, 15.1) on extreme heat days (90th percentile) relative to nonextreme heat days. Conclusion: this study showed that exposure to PM2.5 from vegetation fires and extreme heat independently increased all-cause mortality risk in UNT. However, there was no evidence of a synergistic effect of these events.

AB  - Expanding whole blood sample collection for transcriptome analysis beyond traditional phlebotomy clinics will open new frontiers for remote immune research and telemedicine. Determining the stability of RNA in blood samples exposed to high ambient temperatures (>30 degrees C) is necessary for deploying home-sampling in settings with elevated temperatures (e.g., studying physiological response to natural disasters that occur in warm locations or in the summer). Recently, we have developed homeRNA, a technology that allows for self-blood sampling and RNA stabilization remotely. homeRNA consists of a lancet-based blood collection device, the Tasso-SST (TM) which collects up to 0.5 ml of blood from the upper arm, and a custom-built stabilization transfer tube containing RNAlater (TM). In this study, we investigated the robustness of our homeRNA kit in high temperature settings via two small pilot studies in Doha, Qatar (no. participants= 8), and the Western and South Central USA during the summer of 2021, which included a heatwave of unusually high temperatures in some locations (no. participants = 11). Samples collected from participants in Doha were subjected to rapid external temperature fluctuations from being moved to and from air-conditioned areas and extreme heat environments (up to 41 degrees C external temperature during brief temperature spikes). In the USA pilot study, regions varied in outdoor temperature highs (between 25 degrees C and 43.4 degrees C). All samples that returned a RNA integrity number (RIN) value from the Doha, Qatar group had a RIN >= 7.0, a typical integrity threshold for downstream transcriptomics analysis. RIN values for the Western and South Central USA samples (n = 12 samples) ranged from 6.9-8.7 with 9 out of 12 samples reporting RINs >= 7.0. Overall, our pilot data suggest that homeRNA can be used in some regions that experience elevated temperatures, opening up new geographical frontiers in disseminated transcriptome analysis for applications critical to telemedicine, global health, and expanded clinical research. Further studies, including our ongoing work in Qatar, USA, and Thailand, will continue to test the robustness of homeRNA.

AB  - Background Extreme weather and climate events impact public health in multiple ways and extreme heat is one of the major environmental challenges for public health in Thailand. Objective We assessed the effects of heat stress on occupational health among agricultural workers who are exposed to the heat at different levels for both males and females in different age groups. We further investigated the responses to extreme heat among the government agencies. Methods A cross-sectional study was used to identify heat exposure situations that create heat stress-related health risks. The question guidelines have been developed to assess occupational heat impacts in the study site and used semi-structured interviews to describe how agricultural workers experience heat exposures where they work. The Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) index and temperatures were measured by WBGT monitors in both winter and summer. Twenty-nine participants aged 24-76 were recruited to the study. Results All participants had one or more signs and symptoms of heat stress; however, they had concerns about work-related heat stress prevention. Outdoor WBGT was found to be highest between 11:00 AM and 11:59 AM, and 13:00 PM and 13:59 PM in winter and summer, respectively. Our findings revealed that study sites had heat indices necessitating extreme caution, where sunstroke, muscle cramps, and/or heat exhaustion were possible with prolonged exposure. Conclusions A heat health warning system is essential to reduce the negative impacts of extreme weather.

AB  - The impacts of climate change and global warming have become more visible globally because of the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, abnormal heatwaves, and other climate crises. Besides the traditional survey method, it is beneficial to automatically distillate climate change opinions from social platforms to measure public reactions quickly. We investigate how to organize climate change opinions on Twitter into meaningful categories to support perspective summarizing tasks. We find that merely using the available taxonomy for this task is ineffective; hence we must consider the entire text content. We recommend five high-level categories (Root cause, Impact, Mitigation, Politics or Policy, Others) and assemble ClimateTweets, a dataset with category and polarity labels. In addition, we construct category classification and polarity detection tasks with a range of opinion mining baselines. The experimental results show that both tasks are challenging for existing models. We release the ClimateTweets dataset to facilitate investigation in public opinion mining using text content and artificial intelligent methods. We hope this study could pave the way for future studies in the climate change domain.

AB  - The impact of climate change and related hazards such as floods, heatwaves, and sea level rise on human lives, cities, and their hinterlands depends not only on the nature of the hazard, but also on urban development, adaptation, and other socioeconomic processes that determine vulnerability and exposure. Spatial planning can reduce climate risk not just by influencing the exposure, but also by addressing social vulnerability. This requires that relevant information is available to planners and that plans are implemented and coordinated between sectors. This article is based on a research project in Thailand, particularly on the results of multi-sectoral workshops in the case study region of the Andaman Coast in southern Thailand, and draws upon climate risk, spatial planning, and systems thinking discourses. The article formulates recommendations for planning in the context of Thailand that are relevant for other rapidly growing and urbanizing regions. Among other conclusions, it suggests that systems thinking approaches and cross-sectoral strategies are ways to grasp the interdependencies between and within climate risk and spatial development challenges.

AB  - A fast temperature rise has made the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region a global hotspot of extreme heat events. Previous studies conducted in the region to evaluate extreme heat based on temperature were inadequate for assessing heat based on human thermal impacts. The present study employed the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI). This index evaluates the changes in heat related to human thermal stress in MENA. This analysis employed the ERA5-HEAT dataset, derived from the Copernicus climate change service portal. The results showed that all the regions experienced an average daily UTCI representing extreme heat stress for 1 to 25 days. The daily maximum UTCI goes to the extreme level on average of 1 to 175 days a year, with the highest in the east and southwest. The annual mean UTCI in MENA is increasing from 0.1 to 0.7 degrees C/ decade, with the highest increase in the northeast, covering eastern Saudi Arabia and most parts of Iraq and Syria. This caused a decrease in cold stress and an increase in hot stress days, with the highest increase in strong thermal stress days in the range of 4 to 16 days/decade in most of MENA. The trend in daily maximum UTCI also showed an increase in the range of 0.1 to 0.6 degrees C/decade, which caused an increase in the number of daily maximum UTIC above 46 degrees C or extreme level by 1 to 16 days/per decade, with the highest increase in central Saudi Arabia, northern Sudan and southern Mauritania. This study is the first to investigate UTCI trends in the MENA region and is expected to provide valuable information on hotspots and temporal trends in UTCI, serving as a foundation for future heat action plans to prevent heat-related illnesses throughout the region.

AB  - Applying the homogenized daily data during 1970-2019, this study examined the urbanization effects on changes in a set of extreme climate indices for large cities across Thailand, where has undergone rapid urbanization in recent decades. Analysis revealed positive urbanization effects on a number of the indices related to hot extremes, providing a consistent picture with the previous studies. Larger and more significant urbanization effects were evident for minimum temperature-related extreme indices, probably resulting from stronger nighttime enhancement of the urban heat island (UHI) intensity. From a sub-regional perspective, the urbanization effects for four clusters contributed, on an average, to half of the total trends of temperature extremes. Another noteworthy finding was marked by significant urbanization-induced increases in the amount, frequency, intensity, and magnitude of rainfall extremes at the urban stations in the Bangkok metropolis and the central part of the country. Analysis showed that most of the rainfall indices in this region exhibited a 100% urbanization contribution. These results highlighted that the Bangkok metropolis and its adjacent urban areas experienced substantial increases in climate extremes, resulting in greater risks from their associated disasters. The mechanisms how urbanization has induced changes in climate extremes in Thailand seem to be complex, depending on many factors including increases in UHI intensity, heat absorption in urban boundary layer, urban-rural roughness, anthropogenic aerosol, and pollutant emissions. However, to better understand their underlying physical processes and mechanisms, climate model-based dynamical experiments and additional analysis of highresolution satellite data are further needed.

AB  - On March 1, 2012, the Chinese government implemented the Administrative Measures on Heatstroke Prevention (AMHP2012) to combat the occupational health impacts of extreme heat, and reducing occupational injury was one of the main purposes. This study aimed at quantifying the intervention effects of the AMHP2012 on extreme heat-related occupational injuries and subsequent insurance payouts in Guangzhou, China. Data on occupational injuries and insurance payouts were collected from March 1, 2011, to February 28, 2013, from the occupational injury insurance system of Guangzhou. A quasi-experimental design with before-after control was adopted. Interrupted time series analysis was performed to quantify the change of occupational injuries and insurance payouts after policy implementation. The distributed lag non-linear model was used to explore whether injury claims and insurance payouts due to extreme heat decreased. A total of 9851 injury claims were included in the analysis. After policy implementation, the risk of occupational injuries and insurance payouts decreased by 13% (RR = 0.87, 95%CI: 0.75, 0.99) and 24% (RR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.58, 0.94), respectively. The attributable fraction of extreme heat-related occupational injuries decreased from 3.17% (95%eCI: 1.35, 4.69) to 1.52% (95%eCI: -0.36, 3.15), which contributed to 0.86 million USD reduction of insurance payouts. Both males and females, low-educated, young and middle-aged workers, workers at small or medium-sized enterprises, engaging in manufacturing, and with both minor and severe injuries were apparently associated with decreased rates of extreme heat-related occupational injuries. The AMHP2012 policy contributed to the reduction of extreme heat-related occupational injuries and insurance payouts in Guangzhou, China, and this research provided novel evidence for decision-makers to better understand the necessity of implementing health protection policies among laborers under climate change.

AB  - Over recent decades, warming events in the tropical Indian Ocean (IO) have been documented in both the western and eastern IO. However, the manifestation of marine warming events in the Indonesian waters is still lacking in information. This paper presents the first case study of long-term warming events and short-term extreme warming events off the coast of West Sumatra using Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data covering 37 years (1982-2018). A statistical climate toolbox is applied to quantify the marine warming rates, including Marine Heatwaves (MHWs) identification. Decadal trends in marine warming are positive across the study region indicate significant warming rates with the average value of about 0.15 degrees C decade(-1). In line with the long-term marine warming, MHW events off West Sumatra has been revealed to be increasing in its occurrences, duration, and intensity. Much of this significant increase in MHW properties has occurred during the period 2015-2018. The MHW events off West Sumatra appear to be influenced by El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), particularly during strong El Nino and La Nina periods. These marine warmings trend and MHW events have never been documented and quantified before in the waters around West Sumatra.

AB  - The occurrence of extreme events (such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation) is unprecedented in the observed record and will increase with increasing global warming, leading to severe human health issues. Wearing suitable garments in different weather is one of the solutions for people to ease their physical discomfort in an energy -saving way. However, only one piece of traditional clothes hardly satisfies the demand of the changing weather. Herein, a multi-weather full-body triboelectric garment with a one-way moisture transport structure is presented to keep people feeling cool in the scorching weather while capturing droplet energy in rainy situations. A trilayer progressive wetting structure was designed to effectively transport sweat from the inner layer near the skin to the outer layer to keep the skin dry and comfortable in the muggy air, with a unidirectional transmission index of 1025%. When it starts to rain, the rain droplets quickly roll down the textile surface and generate triboelectric energy with the hydrophobic surface and conductive MXene layer inside. More than that, the scalable fabrication process makes it possible to obtain the textile with enough areas for making a whole garment, which is much more practical in real application scenarios.

AB  - The Asia-Pacific region is extremely vulnerable to climate variability and change. This reflects high exposure to hydroclimatic hazards such as tropical cyclones, floods, droughts, and heatwaves. Rapidly growing cities and low-lying coastal zones/estuaries also face threats from sea level rise and storm surges. However, climate model projections remain very uncertain about most of these risks, so water infrastructure and operations need to consider a range of plausible futures. Against this background, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been developing frameworks, tools, and capacities in climate risk and adaptation assessment and management. Project teams are often operating in data-scarce situations and under significant time constraints, so the emphasis has been on creating pragmatic guidance and training resources. This paper charts the transition of climate risk management (CRM) within the ADB from a predominantly scenario-led to decision-led approach to adaptation. Examples are given of light-touch procedures for screening climate risks, strengthening the transparency and rigour of scenario analysis, raising awareness of a broad range of adaptation options, streamlining identification of CRM options, and embedding allowances for climate change in detailed engineering designs. Such practical innovations would benefit communities of practice beyond the Asia-Pacific region.

AB  - Cambodia is considered extremely vulnerable to climate change due to high poverty, limited infrastructure, and weak adaptive capacity. Kratie province, in particular, has suffered from climate-induced disasters, including floods, droughts, storms, lightning, and heatwaves. To date, climate change interventions in the province have primarily focused on impacts on agriculture. However, enhancing the climate resilience of micro businesses in the tourism and hospitality sector is also crucial since the provincial economy increasingly depends on the interlinkage between agriculture, tourism and related enterprises. This article examines how climate change has impacted micro businesses in Kratie Town, and how they responded to the impacts. This study is based on semi structured interviews with micro entrepreneurs randomly selected in the town. Results show that businesses have been predominantly affected by floods and storms. Business exposures and locations, types of business, production and supply chains, and client bases determined different impacts of and responses to these climate related hazards. Businesses adopted primarily temporary and reactive responses rather than long-term systematic measures. Strengthening adaptive infrastructure, both physical and informational, will improve businesses' capability to prepare for and cope with these disasters.

AB  - As the climate warms, increasing heat-related health risks are expected, and can be exacerbated by the urban heat island (UHI) effect. UHIs can also offer protection against cold weather, but a clear quantification of their impacts on human health across diverse cities and seasons is still being explored. Here we provide a 500 m resolution assessment of mortality risks associated with UHIs for 85 European cities in 2015-2017. Acute impacts are found during heat extremes, with a 45% median increase in mortality risk associated with UHI, compared to a 7% decrease during cold extremes. However, protracted cold seasons result in greater integrated protective effects. On average, UHI-induced heat-/cold-related mortality is associated with economic impacts of euro192/euro - 314 per adult urban inhabitant per year in Europe, comparable to air pollution and transit costs. These findings urge strategies aimed at designing healthier cities to consider the seasonality of UHI impacts, and to account for social costs, their controlling factors, and intra-urban variability.
   Urban heat islands have the greatest acute impacts on human mortality risk during extreme heat. However, protracted cold seasons result in greater annually integrated protective effects in most European cities under the current climate.

AB  - A tropical cyclone (TC) usually induces strong sea-surface cooling due to vertical mixing. In turn, surface cooling influences the intensities and tracks of TCs. Therefore, the relationship between sea-surface temperature (SST) and TC is one of the important components of air-sea interaction. Sea-surface cooling associated with three TCs (Bailu, Lingling, and Mitag) was investigated based on wave-glider observations, satellite altimetry, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology General Circulation Model (MITgcm) numerical experiments from August 3rd to October 10th, 2019. Surface cooling varied among the three TCs. TC Lingling had the nearest distance to the wave-glider position, the slowest translation speed, and the strongest intensity of three TCs, but extreme cooling (1.4) occurred during TC Bailu. Although MITgcm underestimated the extreme cooling, the SST trend driven by the net heat flux, advection, and vertical mixing within the mixed layer was greater during TC Bailu than during other TCs. Advection was the largest of the three heat balance terms during TC Bailu, while it was quite small during the other two TCs. Interestingly, the extreme cooling occurred at the position of preexisting warm eddy. Based on heat balance analysis, we found that the eddy-induced heat advection transport reached -0.4/day, contributing 60% of the heat balance; this was attributed to extreme cooling via eddy disturbance. We suggest TC Bailu leads to the decrease in SST and increase in the area of the cold eddy, and then, the cooled-enlarged eddy is advected to the neighbored position of wave glider, which observes the extreme cooling. These findings provide the utilization of wave gliders and help improve air-sea coupled models during TCs.

AB  - While it has been concluded that climate change poses a significant threat to worldwide supply of freshwater resources, it is unclear if and how demand for water would also be affected. To fill this knowledge gap, we leverage on 'big data' collected using smart water meters from over 40,000 Chinese urban households, spanning nine years and ten provinces to examine the relationship between daily household water usage and climate variability. At the baseline, we find that municipal water is not only a coping mechanism for heat, but its usage is accelerated during heatwave events. Heterogeneity analyses reveal that households from lower-valued properties are more likely to substitute water for electricity to counter heat. Importantly, we find evidence of adaptation behaviors where over time, households are using increasingly more water to cope with high-temperature days. In all, after feeding our results into climate projection models, it is estimated that household water usage will in-crease by around 7-44% in the long-term (2080-2099) under emissions scenarios of SSP245 and SSP370. Our findings are especially relevant for water-scarce countries such as China as well as developing countries where water is a cheaper and more accessible resource to cope with heat.

AB  - Increased heat stress affects well-being, comfort, and economic activities across the world. It also causes a significant decrease in work performance, as well as heat-related mortality. This study aims to investigate the impacts of the projected climate change scenario under RCP8.5 on heat stress and associated work performance in Thailand during the years 2020-2029. The model evaluation shows exceptional performance in the present-day simulation (1990-1999) of temperature and relative humidity, with R-2 values ranging from 0.79 to 0.87; however, the modeled temperature and relative humidity are all underestimated when compared to observation data by -0.9 degrees C and -27%, respectively. The model results show that the temperature change will tend to increase by 0.62 degrees C per decade in the future. This could lead to an increase in the heat index by 2.57 degrees C if the temperature increases by up to 1.5 degrees C in Thailand. The effect of climate change is predicted to increase heat stress by 0.1 degrees C to 4 degrees C and to reduce work performance in the range of 4% to >10% across Thailand during the years 2020 and 2029.

AB  - The absence of vegetation in urban areas contributes to the establishment of the urban heat island, markedly increasing thermal stress for residents, driving morbidity and mortality. Mitigation strategies are, therefore, needed to reduce urban heat, particularly against a background of urbanization, anthropogenic warming and increasing frequency and intensity of heatwaves. In this Review, we evaluate the potential of green infrastructure as a mitigation strategy, focusing on greenery on the ground (parks) and greenery on buildings (green roofs and green walls). Green infrastructure acts to cool the urban environment through shade provision and evapotranspiration. Typically, greenery on the ground reduces peak surface temperature by 2-9 degrees C, while green roofs and green walls reduce surface temperature by similar to 17 degrees C, also providing added thermal insulation for the building envelope. However, the cooling potential varies markedly, depending on the scale of interest (city or building level), greenery extent (park shape and size), plant selection and plant placement. Urban planners must, therefore, optimize design to maximize mitigation benefits, for example, by interspersing parks throughout a city, allocating more trees than lawn space and using multiple strategies in areas where most cooling is required. To do so, improved translation of scientific understanding to practical design guidelines is needed.

AB  - Over one hundred years of vigorous progress in tropical cyclone (TC) research, the genesis of the cyclone (hereafter, tropical cyclogenesis) is remarkable as a doubtful subject. Furthermore, predicting tropical cyclogenesis, particularly in the lesser latitude, remains a significant challenge. Therefore, understanding the complex interactions in developing tropical cyclogenesis over the region is vital to improving tropical cyclogenesis forecasting. Hence, the Indonesia Maritime Continent is a tropical cyclone-free region due to decreasing the Coriolis effect. However, Seroja TC hit Flores (8.6 degrees S, 120 degrees E), east Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia, on 4 April 2021, and was recorded as the first TC that occurred over the mainland, which brought a catastrophic disaster in the region. This study investigated the tropical cyclogenesis of Seroja by using observational and numerical studies. The results indicate that a marine heatwave and double vortices were favorable conditions that produced preconditions for developing tropical cyclogenesis over the Maluku Sea. Thus, tropical cyclogenesis is formed by the breakdown of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) associated with synoptic-scale wave train driven under the interaction of the Madden Julian oscillation (MJO) and equatorial Rossby waves. Moreover, our finding suggested that an extensive background cyclonic vorticity under the cold pool mechanisms is responsible for maintaining tropical cyclogenesis into a persistent Seroja TC.

AB  - Rising temperatures and alteration of other meteorological parameters in the Indian monsoon region have exposed billions of populations in densely populated South Asia to extreme heat. This study employed high resolution ERA5 reanalysis data for assessing spatiotemporal changes in outdoor WBGT over South Asia for the period 1979-2021. The area affected and the population exposed to different heat levels were also estimated using LandScan population datasets. The results revealed an increase in the annual average daily mean WBGT by 0.1-0.5 degrees C/decade while the monsoon and pre-monsoon mean WBGT by 0.1-0.7 degrees C/decade over most of South Asia. The large increase in WBGT caused a rise in areas exposed to extreme heat by 56% and 66% during monsoon and pre-monsoon, respectively. Consequently, 17 million more people have been exposed to excessive heat each year. The study also revealed an increase in extremely hot days by more than six days/decade over a major part of the study area. These findings and accompanying maps can be useful to future efforts to lessen the likelihood of heat-related illness in South Asian nations, where temperature extremes have grown rapidly in recent years.

AB  - Epidemiological studies have reported the association between extreme temperatures and adverse reproductive effects. However, the susceptible period of exposure during pregnancy remains unclear. This study aimed to assess the impact of extreme temperature on the stillbirth rate. We performed a time-series analysis to explore the associations between temperature and stillbirth with a distributed lag nonlinear model. A total of 22,769 stillbirths in Taiwan between 2009 and 2018 were enrolled. The mean stillbirth rate was 11.3 +/- 1.4 per 1000 births. The relative risk of stillbirth due to exposure to extreme heat temperature (> 29 degrees C) was 1.18 (95% CI 1.11, 1.25). Pregnant women in the third trimester were most susceptible to the effects of extreme cold and heat temperatures. At lag of 0-3 months, the cumulative relative risk (CRR) of stillbirth for exposure to extreme heat temperature (29.8 degrees C, 97.5th percentile of temperature) relative to the optimal temperature (21 degrees C) was 2.49 (95% CI: 1.24, 5.03), and the CRR of stillbirth for exposure to extreme low temperature (16.5 degrees C, 1st percentile) was 1.29 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.80). The stillbirth rate in Taiwan is on the rise. Our findings inform public health interventions to manage the health impacts of climate change.

AB  - Concurrent meteorological extremes (CMEs) represent a class of pernicious climatic events characterized by the coexistence of two extreme weather phenomena. Specifically, the juxtaposition of Urban Extreme Rainfall (UER) and Urban Extreme Heat (UEH) can precipitate disproportionately deleterious impacts on both ecological systems and human well-being. In this investigation, we embarked on a meticulous risk appraisal of CMEs within China's Greater Bay Area (GBA), harnessing the predictive capabilities of three shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) namely, SSP1-2.6, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5, in conjunction with the EC-Earth3-Veg-LR model from the CMIP6 suite. The findings evidence a pronounced augmentation in CME occurrences, most notably under the SSP1-2.6 trajectory. Intriguingly, the SSP5-8.5 pathway, typified by elevated levels of greenhouse gas effluents, prognosticated the most intense CMEs, albeit with a temperate surge upon occurrence. Additionally, an ascendant trend in the ratio of CMEs to the aggregate of UER and UEH portends an escalating susceptibility to these combined events in ensuing decades. A sensitivity analysis accentuated the pivotal interplay between UER and UEH as a catalyst for the proliferation of CMEs, modulated by alterations in their respective marginal distributions. Such revelations accentuate the imperative of assimilating intricate interdependencies among climatic anomalies into evaluative paradigms for devising efficacious climate change countermeasures. The risk assessment paradigm proffered herein furnishes a formidable instrument for gauging the calamitous potential of CMEs in a dynamically shifting climate, thereby refining the precision of prospective risk estimations.

AB  - Accelerated growth in urban populations has become a powerful force for human development, particularly in developed countries. Metropolitan cities are centers for technical and economic advancement, but air pollution, overflowing of water, and other climate effects still pose significant problems related to nature, climate, and the environment. Cities are vulnerable to increasingly dense, diverse, and interdependent urban systems. A single extreme occurrence can contribute to a systemic break-up of a city's infrastructure, often like dominoes. In this paper, a dynamic integration-assisted population management solution (DI-PMS) has been proposed. DI-PMS recognizes that the latest facilities' optimal usage of knowledge and technologies is needed to increase urbanization. They are one of the critical priorities of the weather community. Such integrated urban weather, environmental, and climate services will help cities address dangers including storms, floods, heatwaves, and air pollution, especially in climate change. The goal is to create urban facilities that satisfy communities' unique needs by high-resolution forecasting and pollution reduction climate services, which allow the construction of durable, robust, and thriving cities that support the Sustainable Development Goals. Several recent international surveys to explore these topics have been undertaken. DI-PMS gives a brief description of urban hydrometeorological, climate and air pollution activities, outlines the new urban integrated weather and environmental services concept, and emphasizes the need for science to be implemented.

AB  - Photosynthetic heat tolerance (P-HT) is a key predictor of plant response to climate change. Mangroves are an ecologically and economically important coastal plant community comprised of trees growing at their physiological limits. Mangroves are currently impacted by global warming, yet the P-HT of mangrove trees is poorly understood. In this study, we provide the first assessment of P-HT in 13 Asian mangrove species, based on the critical temperature that causes the initial damage (T-Crit) and the temperature that causes 50% damage (T-50) to photosystem II. We tested the hypotheses that the P-HT in mangroves is: (i) correlated with climatic niche and leaf traits, and (ii) higher than in plants from other tropical ecosystems. Our results demonstrated correlations between P-HT and multiple key climate variables, the palisade to spongy mesophyll ratio and the leaf area. The two most heat-sensitive species were Kandelia obovata and Avicennia marina. Our study also revealed that mangrove trees show high heat tolerance compared to plants from other tropical ecosystems. The high P-HT of mangroves thus demonstrated a conservative evolutionary strategy in heat tolerance, and highlights the need for integrative and comparative studies on thermoregulatory traits and climatic niche in order to understand the physiological response of mangrove trees to climate change-driven heatwaves and rising global temperatures.

AB  - This research projects future climate change-induced urban heat island (UHI) trends (2022-2099) using three dynamically downscaled regional climate models (RCM1 - RCM3) under two repre-sentative concentration pathways: RCP4.5 and 8.5. RCP 4.5 is a moderate scenario in which emissions peak around 2040 and then decline, while RCP 8.5 is the highest baseline emissions scenario in which emissions continue to rise throughout the twenty-first century. An RCM is a numerical climate prediction model forced by specified lateral and ocean conditions from observation-based dataset that simulates atmospheric and land surface processes. In the study, the RCMs are based on three respective global climate models: ICHEC-EC-EARTH, MPI-M-MPI-ESM-MR and NOAA-GFDL-GFDL-ESM2M. The study area is Thailand's capital Bangkok, and the UHI trends are determined by the Mann-Kendall trends and Sen's slope estimates of 13 future temperature-based extreme climate indexes, consisting of nine warm extreme indexes and four cold extreme indexes. The findings reveal that the majority of the warm extreme indexes are trending upward, while most of the cold indexes exhibit a downward trend. In essence, the Bangkok metropolitan area highly likely experiences warmer temperatures in the future, contributing to higher land surface temperature and UHI intensity.

By comparing the nature of farming activities performed by conventional farmworkers and agroecological farmers, this study examined the changes in physiological health in responses to heat exposure through a six-month longitudinal study. Throughout the six-month follow-up period, the heat stress index (HSI), physiological strain indices (PSI), and physiological health parameters (BMI, blood glucose level, blood cholesterol level, uric acid level) were measured and repeated every two-month. Physiological parameters were recorded twice daily, before and during their first lunch break. This study found that slow-onset heat stress affects farmers differently. The health of agroecological farmers is more resistant to slow-onset extreme temperatures. Pre-existing metabolic health effects from pesticide exposure make conventional farmers more susceptible to extreme temperatures, delaying their bodies' adaptation to rising temperatures.

AB  - Bleaching or the expulsion of the photosynthetic symbiont Symbiodiniaceae ('zooxanthellae') caused by the increase in seawater temperatures causes massive mortalities in giant clams. After a bleaching disturbance, population recovery is heavily dependent on reproduction and recruitment success. However, how bleaching directly affects the reproductive performance of giant clams is, to date, unknown. Here, we examined the direct impacts of bleaching on the reproduction of the giant clam Tridacna gigas between 2020 and 2021 in the Philippines. A continuous 6 mo monitoring of egg concentration, egg stage, egg size, recovery, and survival in prolonged bleached (moderate or severe) and non-bleached hatchery-bred T. gigas maintained in the wild was conducted. The probability of producing eggs and the proportion of intact eggs (developing and mature) were highest in healthy giant clams, followed by moderately bleached giant clams, and lowest in severely bleached giant clams in which >50% individuals had empty gonads. The oocyte mean diameter was similar among giant clams, regardless of degree of bleaching. Only 5 severely bleached giant clams showed partial color recovery, whereas 2 healthy and 12 severely bleached giant clams died. This study shows that apart from the lethal effects of severe bleaching, the reproductive processes of surviving bleached T. gigas such as gametogenesis and egg production can be also negatively affected. Results suggest that the increasing frequency and intensity of bleaching due to thermal stress can lower the reproductive potential of giant clams and likely other zooxanthellate organisms, resulting in reduced recruitment and population decline.

AB  - Urban analysis at different spatial scales (micro- and mesoscale) of local climate conditions is required to test typical artificial urban boundaries and related climate hazards such as high temperatures in built environments. The multitude of finishing materials and sheltering objects within built environments produce distinct patterns of different climate conditions, particularly during the daytime. The combination of high temperatures and intense solar radiation strongly perturb the environment by increasing the thermal heat stress at the pedestrian level. Therefore, it is becoming common practice to use numerical models and tools that enable multiple design and planning alternatives to be quantitatively and qualitatively tested to inform urban planners and decision-makers. These models and tools can be used to compare the relationships between the micro-climatic environment, the subjective thermal assessment, and the social behaviour, which can reveal the attractiveness and effectiveness of new urban spaces and lead to more sustainable and liveable public spaces. This review article presents the applications of selected environmental numerical models and tools to predict human thermal stress at the mesoscale (e.g., satellite thermal images and UrbClim) and the microscale (e.g., mobile measurements, ENVI-met, and UrbClim HR) focusing on case study cities in mid-latitude climate regions framed in two European research projects.

AB  - Current climate change aggravates human health hazards posed by heat stress. Forests can locally mitigate this by acting as strong thermal buffers, yet potential mediation by forest ecological characteristics remains underexplored. We report over 14 months of hourly microclimate data from 131 forest plots across four European countries and compare these to open-field controls using physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) to reflect human thermal perception. Forests slightly tempered cold extremes, but the strongest buffering occurred under very hot conditions (PET >35 degrees C), where forests reduced strong to extreme heat stress day occurrence by 84.1%. Mature forests cooled the microclimate by 12.1 to 14.5 degrees C PET under, respectively, strong and extreme heat stress conditions. Even young plantations reduced those conditions by 10 degrees C PET. Forest structure strongly modulated the buffering capacity, which was enhanced by increasing stand density, canopy height and canopy closure. Tree species composition had a more modest yet significant influence: that is, strongly shade-casting, small-leaved evergreen species amplified cooling. Tree diversity had little direct influences, though indirect effects through stand structure remain possible. Forests in general, both young and mature, are thus strong thermal stress reducers, but their cooling potential can be even further amplified, given targeted (urban) forest management that considers these new insights.

AB  - Extreme warming events that contribute to mass coral bleaching are occurring with increasing regularity, raising questions about their effect on coral reef ecological interactions. However, the effects of such events on parasite-host interactions are largely ignored. Gnathiid isopods are common, highly mobile, external parasites of coral reef fishes, that feed on blood during the juvenile stage. They have direct and indirect impacts on their fish hosts, and are the major food source for cleaner fishes. However, how these interactions might be impacted by increased temperatures is unknown. We examined the effects of acute temperature increases, similar to those observed during mass bleaching events, on survivorship of gnathiid isopod juveniles. Laboratory experiments were conducted using individuals from one species (Gnathia aureamaculosa) from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), and multiple unknown species from the central Philippines. Fed and unfed GBR gnathiids were held in temperature treatments of 29 degrees C to 32 degrees C and fed Philippines gnathiids were held at 28 degrees C to 36 degrees C. Gnathiids from both locations showed rapid mortality when held in temperatures 2 degrees C to 3 degrees C above average seasonal sea surface temperature (32 degrees C). This suggests environmental changes in temperature can influence gnathiid survival, which could have significant ecological consequences for host-parasite-cleaner fish interactions during increased temperature events.

AB  - Rural Research Stations (RRS), Refugee Camps Motorhomes and Caravans are in need of a portable Compact Heating, Cooling and Power (CHCP) generating device. Heating and power generation devices with diesel as driving source of energy are available commercially. In this paper, an innovative compact heating, cooling and power generating device which uses renewable hydrogen and suits rural areas, extreme weather conditions and disastrous situations is proposed. The device is driven by renewable hydrogen fuel generated by PV electrolysis as the source of energy. Low vibration low noise Stirling Engine (SE) is used as mechanical energy converter. Generator is used as electrical energy converter and heat pump is used for supplying heating and cooling effects. The proposed device has many advantages such as encouraging the rural tourism, supply rural research stations the heating and/or cooling loads and contribute in saving lives in the extreme weather conditions and disastrous situations. Analysis of the proposed device in terms of workability and performance was performed. Results showed that renewable energy base, electricity independent, silent, low vibration and better performance were achieved (OHR 1/4 2.662) with the current device compared to available devices.

AB  - As climate change increases temperatures and the frequency of extreme heat events, farm workers are among the most affected. Because of the nature of the work, farmers working at hot temperatures may experience physiological changes in their body such as increases in body temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate, as well as leading to intolerance of blood glucose and blood cholesterol. This study speculates that extreme heat hazards may lead to incidence of heat-related diseases among farmers in the workplace and other metabolic disorders. The purpose of this study is to determine the potential health effects of heat exposure between agroecology and conventional rice farmers. This study recruited 33 agroecology and 25 conventional rice farmers in the northern state of peninsular Malaysia. The adapted questionnaire was used to obtain the respondent's background information. Also, the environmental and physiological measurements were carried out to determine the heat stress index (HSI) and physiological strain index (PSI). The HSI was monitored by using WetBulb globe temperature meter, whereas the physiological parameters were assessed by using thermometer, blood pressure monitor, and blood cholesterol/glucose monitor kit. The study shows that there is a significant difference between HSI, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels among organic and conventional farmers. Both groups of farmers also have a significant association between blood glucose and blood pressure. The findings of this study suggest that pesticide use can act as a synergistic effect, resulting in more significant health effects for those who were exposed to heat in their work environment. Given the impact of climate change on the agriculture sector, the disparity in the heat-related health effects between pesticides used and nonpesticides used farming community may serve as a critical factor to consider while implementing the workplace heat stress program in the agricultural industry.

AB  - Background:Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Existing studies on the association between temperatures and cardiovascular deaths have been limited in geographic zones and have generally considered associations with total cardiovascular deaths rather than cause-specific cardiovascular deaths. Methods:We used unified data collection protocols within the Multi-Country Multi-City Collaborative Network to assemble a database of daily counts of specific cardiovascular causes of death from 567 cities in 27 countries across 5 continents in overlapping periods ranging from 1979 to 2019. City-specific daily ambient temperatures were obtained from weather stations and climate reanalysis models. To investigate cardiovascular mortality associations with extreme hot and cold temperatures, we fit case-crossover models in each city and then used a mixed-effects meta-analytic framework to pool individual city estimates. Extreme temperature percentiles were compared with the minimum mortality temperature in each location. Excess deaths were calculated for a range of extreme temperature days. Results:The analyses included deaths from any cardiovascular cause (32 154 935), ischemic heart disease (11 745 880), stroke (9 351 312), heart failure (3 673 723), and arrhythmia (670 859). At extreme temperature percentiles, heat (99th percentile) and cold (1st percentile) were associated with higher risk of dying from any cardiovascular cause, ischemic heart disease, stroke, and heart failure as compared to the minimum mortality temperature, which is the temperature associated with least mortality. Across a range of extreme temperatures, hot days (above 97.5th percentile) and cold days (below 2.5th percentile) accounted for 2.2 (95% empirical CI [eCI], 2.1-2.3) and 9.1 (95% eCI, 8.9-9.2) excess deaths for every 1000 cardiovascular deaths, respectively. Heart failure was associated with the highest excess deaths proportion from extreme hot and cold days with 2.6 (95% eCI, 2.4-2.8) and 12.8 (95% eCI, 12.2-13.1) for every 1000 heart failure deaths, respectively. Conclusions:Across a large, multinational sample, exposure to extreme hot and cold temperatures was associated with a greater risk of mortality from multiple common cardiovascular conditions. The intersections between extreme temperatures and cardiovascular health need to be thoroughly characterized in the present day-and especially under a changing climate.

AB  - We estimate the impact of temperature extremes on mortality in Vietnam, using daily data on temperatures and monthly data on mortality during the 2000-2018 period. We find that both cold and heat waves cause higher mortality, particularly among older people and those living in the hot regions in Southern Vietnam. This effect on mortality tends to be smaller in provinces with higher rates of air-conditioning and emigration, and provinces with higher public spending on health. Finally, we estimate economic cost of cold and heat waves using a framework of willingness to pay to avoid deaths, then project the cost to the year 2100 under different Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios.

AB  - Giant clams are threatened by overexploitation for human consumption, their valuable shells and the aquarium trade. Consequently, these iconic coral reef megafauna are extinct in some former areas of their range and are included in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species and Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Now, giant clams are also threatened by rapid environmental change from both a suite of local and regional scale stressors and global change, including climate change, global warming, marine heatwaves and ocean acidification. The interplay between local- to regional-scale and global-scale drivers is likely to cause an array of lethal and sub-lethal effects on giant clams, potentially limiting their depth distribution on coral reefs and decreasing suitable habitat area within natural ranges of species. Global change stressors, pervasive both in unprotected and protected areas, threaten to diminish conservation efforts to date. International efforts urgently need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to avoid lethal and sub-lethal effects of global change on giant clams. Meanwhile, knowledge of giant clam physiological and ecological responses to local-regional and global stressors could play a critical role in conservation strategies of these threatened species through rapid environmental change. Further work on how biological responses translate into habitat requirements as global change progresses, selective breeding for resilience, the capacity for rapid adaptive responses of the giant clam holobiont and valuing tourism potential, including recognizing giant clams as a flagship species for coral reefs, may help improve the prospects of these charismatic megafauna over the coming decades.

AB  - Due to the changing climate, more frequent and prolonged heatwaves are expected to have a catastrophic consequence on urban human settlement. In tropical cities such as Kuala Lumpur (KL), the quality of the urban environment is made worse by urban heat island (UHI) phenomena due to poor urban planning practices. The prolonged exposure to urban heat is hypothesized to influence human health and well-being, especially in tropical urban areas with high population density. Therefore, a study was conducted to understand the association of urban heat stress with physical, psychosomatic and psychological (PPP) health symptoms within a tropical urban setting. Continuous urban microclimate monitoring is conducted using an automated weather station to define the level of heat stress in the study area expressed as Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET). A crosssectional approach is used to identify heat-related health symptoms experienced by the urban population. Through exploratory factor analysis, a total of 38 PPP health symptoms are reduced into 8 heat-related health clusters which are sensory organ pain, heat-related illnesses, cardiopulmonary, pain, fatigue, anxiety, somatization, and depression-related symptoms. Heat stress was found to significantly affect psychosomatic pain (p = 0.016) as well as psychological anxiety (p = 0.022) and somatization (p = 0.041) related symptoms. Other health clusters were not significantly associated with heat stress. More studies are needed to unravel the influence of confounding factors and the long-term impact of urban heat on the health and well-being of the urban population in a tropical city.

AB  - Efforts to restore coral reefs usually involve transplanting asexually propagated fast-growing corals. However, this approach can lead to outplanted populations with low genotypic diversity, composed of taxa susceptible to stressors such as marine heatwaves. Sexual coral propagation leads to greater genotypic diversity, and using slow-growing, stress-tolerant taxa may provide a longer-term return on restoration efforts due to higher outplant survival. However, there have been no reports to date detailing the full cycle of rearing stress-tolerant, slow-growing corals from eggs until sexual maturity. Here, we sexually propagated and transplanted two massive slow-growing coral species to examine long-term success as part of reef restoration efforts. Coral spat were settled on artificial substrates and reared in nurseries for approximately two years, before being outplanted and monitored for survivorship and growth for a further four years. More than half of initially settled substrates supported a living coral following nursery rearing, and survivorship was also high following outplantation with yields declining by just 10 to 14% over four years. At 6-years post-fertilisation over 90% of outplanted corals were reproductively mature, demonstrating the feasibility of restoring populations of sexually mature massive corals in under a decade. Although use of slower growing, stress tolerant corals for reef restoration may provide a longer-term return on investment due to high post-transplantation survival rates, considerable time is required to achieve even modest gains in coral cover due to their relatively slow rates of growth. This highlights the need to use a mix of species with a range of life-history traits in reef restoration and to improve survivorship of susceptible fast-growing taxa that can generate rapid increases in coral cover.

AB  - Land surface temperature is predicted to increase by 0.2 degree celsius per decade due to climate change, although with considerable regional variability, and heatwaves are predicted to increase markedly in the future. These changes will affect where crops can be grown in the future. Understanding the thermal limits of plant physiological functioning and how flexible such limits are is thus important. Here, we report on the measurements of a core foliar thermotolerance trait, T-50, defined as the temperature at which the maximum quantum yield (F-v/F-m) of photosystem II declines by 50%, across nine different Malaysian Hevea brasiliensis clones. We explore the relative importance of interclonal versus intraclonal variation in T-50 as well as its association with leaf and hydraulic traits. We find very low variation in T-50 within individual clones (mean intraclonal coefficient of variation (CoV) of 1.26%) and little variation across clones (interclonal CoV of 2.1%). The interclonal variation in T-50 was lower than for all other functional traits considered. The T-50 was negatively related to leaf mass per area and leaf dry matter content, but it was not related to hydraulic traits such as embolism resistance (P-50) or hydraulic safety margins (HSM50). The range of T-50 observed (42.9-46.2 degree celsius) is well above the current maximum air temperatures T-max,(obs) (T-50 - T-max,(obs) >5.8 degree celsius), suggesting that H. brasiliensis is likely thermally safe in this south-east Asian region of Malaysia.

AB  - As the linkages between extreme weather events, changes in climatic conditions and health impacts in exposed populations become clearer, so does the need for climate-smart decisions aimed at making the public health sector more responsive and resilient. By integrating climate and health information, climate services for health provide robust decision-support tools. The Lancet Countdown monitoring system uses global climate reanalyses products to track annual changes in a set of health-related outcomes. In the monitoring system, multiple variables from reanalysis datasets such as ERA5 and ERA5-Land are retrieved and processed to capture heatwaves, precipitation extremes, wildfires, droughts, warming and ecosystem changes across the globe and over multiple decades. This reanalysis-derived information is then input into a hazard-exposure-vulnerability framework that delivers, as outcomes, indicators tracking the year-by-year impacts of climate-related hazards on human mortality, labour capacity, physical activity, sentiment, infectious disease transmission, and food security and undernutrition. Building on the reanalysis gridded format, the indicators create worldwide 'maps without gaps' of climate-health linkages. Our experience shows that reanalysis datasets allow standardization across the climate information used in the framework, making the system potentially adaptable to multiple geographical scales. An ongoing challenge is to quantify how the inherent bias of global reanalyses influences indicator outcomes. We foresee the health sector as a key user of reanalysis products. Therefore, public health professionals and health impact modellers should be involved in the co-development of future iterations of reanalysis datasets, to reach finer spatial resolutions and provide a wider set of health-relevant climate variables.

AB  - Seaweed has garnered increasing interest due to its capacity to mitigate climate change by curbing carbon emissions from agriculture, as well as its potential to serve as a supplement or alternative for dietary, livestock feed, or fuel source production. Moreover, seaweed is regarded as one of the earliest plant forms to have evolved on Earth. Owing to the extensive body of literature available and the uncertainty surrounding the future trajectory of seaweed research under evolving climate conditions, this review scrutinizes the structure, dynamics, and progression of the literature pertaining to seaweed and climate change. This analysis is grounded in the Web of Science Core Collection database, augmented by CiteSpace software. Furthermore, we discuss the productivity and influence of individual researchers, research organizations, countries, and scientific journals. To date, there have been 8047 articles published globally (after a series of filters and exclusions), with a notable upswing in publication frequency since 2018. The USA, China, and Australia are among the leading countries contributing to this research area. Our findings reveal that current research on seaweed and climate change encompasses 13 distinct research clusters, including "marine heatwave", "temperate estuary", "ocean acidification", and "macroalgal bloom". The most frequently cited keywords are "climate change", "biomass", "community", and "photosynthesis". The seaweed species most commonly referenced in relation to climate change include Gracilaria sp., Sargassum sp., Ecklonia maxima, and Macrocystis pyrifera. These results provide valuable guidance for shaping the direction of specialized topics concerning marine biodiversity under shifting climate conditions. We propose that seaweed production may be compromised during prolonged episodes of reduced water availability, emphasizing the need to formulate strategies to guarantee its continued viability.

AB  - BackgroundThis study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and epidemiology of heat-related illnesses presented at a tertiary hospital in Singapore.MethodThis retrospective observational study utilized electronic health records from the emergency department (ED) of Singapore General Hospital. Patients primarily diagnosed with heat-related illnesses from 2008 to 2020, were analyzed. The annual number of cases and the temporal trend of heat-related illnesses were described, along with the characteristics of patients.ResultsAmong the 1,833,908 patients registered at the ED, 426 patients had diagnoses of heat-related illnesses. The median age (interquartile range [IQR]) was 32 (22, 43) years, with 303 (71%) being male and 201 (47%) not being Singapore citizens. The annual number of cases ranged from a minimum of 21 in 2019 to a maximum of 49 cases in 2015, except for four cases in 2020. Heat-related illnesses occurred most commonly on Sundays (233, 55%) and in December (97, 23%). A significant number of cases in December coincided with the day of an annually organized marathon (91, 21%). Approximately half of the total cases required hospitalization, with 183 (43%) admitted to the general ward and 31 (7%) admitted to the intensive care unit. The 30-day mortality was 2 (0.5%).ConclusionThis descriptive study indicated the unique characteristics of heat-related illness in a tertiary care hospital in Singapore. These local contexts may be valuable to consider preventative measures for heat-related illness, in preparation for future extreme weather events related to climate change.

AB  - Anthropogenic heat is one of the key factors that causes intensive Urban Heat Island (UHI) due to its direct impact on ambient temperature in urban areas. Stagnated airflow due to closely packed tall buildings causes weak dilution and removal of anthmpogenic heat. Consequently, research is critically needed to investigate the effect of urban morphology on anthmpogenic heat dispersion and provide effective planning strategies to reduce UHI intensity, especially at the extreme scenarios, such as with very low wind speed and high heat emission. This study provides scientific understanding and develops a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based modelling tool to support decision-making in urban planning practice. We start from a computational parametric study at the neighbourhood scale to investigate the impact of urban morphology on heat dispersion. Site coverage ratio and frontal area density are two urban morphological parameters. Ten parametric cases with two heat emission scenarios are designed to study representative urban areas. Furthermore, based on the energy conservation within urban canopy layers, we develop a semi-empirical model to estimate spatially-averaged in-canopy air temperature increment, in which the exchange velocity between street canyons and overlaying atmosphere is estimated by the Bentham and Britter model. The performance of new model is validated by cross-comparing with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) results from the parametric study. By applying this new model, the impact of anthmpogenic heat on air temperature is mapped in residential areas of Singapore for both long-term annually averaged and short-term extreme low wind speed to improve urban climate sustainability and resilience.

AB  - Combined effects of global warming and rapid urbanization replace green spaces with urban facilities. Children in urban areas are at a higher risk of heat-related adverse health effects. Our study aimed to examine the protective effect of urban green space on heat-related respiratory hospitalization among children under 5 years of age in Hanoi, the capital city of Vietnam. We estimated district-specific meteorological conditions from 2010 to 2014 by using a dynamic downscaling approach with a fine-resolution numerical climate model. The green space in each district was calculated using satellite data. The attributable fraction of heat-related respiratory hospitalization was estimated using a two-stage model, including a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) coupled with multivariate meta-analysis. The association between heat-related respiratory hospitalization and green spaces at the district level was explored using a linear regression model. The central districts were more crowded and hotter, with less green spaces than the outer districts. At temperatures >34 degrees C (extreme heat threshold), the hospitalizations in the central districts increased significantly; however, in the outer districts, the hospitalization rate was insignificant. On average, extreme heat attributed 0.33% to citywide hospitalization, 0.35% in the center, and 0.32% in the outer region. Every 1% increase in the green space fraction will reduce heat-related respiratory hospitalization risk by 3.8%. Heat significantly increased the risk of respiratory hospitalization among children under 5 years in Hanoi, Vietnam. These findings are valuable for authorities to consider strategies to protect children's health against the effects of heat, including increasing green space.

AB  - Air pollution and extreme heat have been responsible for more than a million deaths in China every year, especially in densely urbanized regions. While previous studies intensively evaluated air pollution episodes and extreme heat events, a limited number of studies comprehensively assessed atmospheric hot-and-polluted-episodes (HPE) - an episode with simultaneously high levels of air pollution and temperature - which have potential adverse synergic impacts on human health. This study focused on the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of China due to its high temperature in summer and poor air quality throughout a year. We employed geostatistical downscaling to model meteorology at a spatial resolution of 1 km, and applied a machine learning algorithm (XGBoost) to estimate a high-resolution (1 km) daily concentration of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) and ozone (O-3) for June to October over 20 years (2000-2019). Our results indicate an increasing trend (similar to 50%) in the frequency of HPE occurrence in the first decade (2000-2010). Conversely, the annual frequency of HPE occurrence reduced (16.7%), but its intensity increased during the second decade (2010-2019). The northern cities in the PRD region had higher levels of PM2.5 and O-3 than their southern counterparts. During HPEs, regional daily PM2.5 exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) and Chinese guideline levels by 75% and 25%, respectively, while the O-3 exceeded the WHO O-3 standard by up to 69%. Overall, 567,063 (95% confidence interval (CI): 510,357-623,770) and 52,231 (95%CI: 26,116-78,346) excessive deaths were respectively attributable to exposure to PM2.5 and O-3 in the PRD region. Our findings imply the necessity and urgency to formulate co-benefit policies to mitigate the region's air pollution and heat problems.

AB  - Amplification in extreme precipitation intensity and frequency can cause severe flooding and impose significant social and economic consequences. Variations in extreme precipitation intensity, frequencies, and return periods can be attributed to many physical variables across spatial and temporal scales. Here we employ ensemble machine learning (ML) methods, namely random forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and artificial neural networks (ANN), to explore key contributing variables to monthly extreme precipitation intensity and frequency in six regions over the United States. We further establish emulators for return periods. Results show that the ML models for intensity perform better in regions with obvious seasonality (i.e., Northern Great Plains, Southern Great Plains, and West Coast) than the other three regions (Northeast, Southwest, and Rocky Mountains), while for frequency the models perform well for most regions. The Shapley additive explanation is used to help explain the relationships between extreme precipitation characteristics and identify top variables for RF and XGB. We find that latent heat flux, relative humidity, soil moisture, and large-scale subsidence are key common variables across the regions for both monthly intensity and frequency, and their compound effects are non-negligible. The developed ML models capture the probability and return period of extreme precipitation well for all regions and may be used for decision making (e.g., infrastructure planning and design).

AB  - Damage to the car compartment, thermal discomfort, fuel wastage, health risks, and the death threat of passengers/pets in the cabin due to high temperatures in cars parked under the sun is an interesting discussion. Therefore, this research examines the characteristics of solar cells-based cabin cooler system on car parked under the sun. Four ST32M100W-FLP solar panels installed on the car roof are used to activate the existing evaporator blower with modified wiring lines. The blower is activated in two modes, i.e addition and without addition of external air at blower speed levels 1 (((m)over dot) =0.0086 kg/s) and level 2 (((m)over dot) =0.0114 kg/s). The results showed that the car cabin cooler able to reduce cabin temperature by 9.8 degrees C. In addition to temperature reduction, latent and sensible cooling effect, as well as heat index (HI) are also discussed in this paper. It was found that due to increased humidity, the release of sensible heat affects the car cabin cooling while parked under the sun from noon to afternoon. Finally, the car cabin cooler can reduce the heat index (HI) from danger and extreme danger categories to caution and extreme caution category.

AB  - The threat and crisis of food due to global warming has a related with global climate change. The threat of a decline in food production in various countries by climate change triggers a long drought. The increase in temperature causes heat stress on the plant which has an impact on the decline in land quality and others. Heat stress is often defined as an increase in temperature for a certain period of time, which can cause irreversible damage to plants, which generally occurs at temperatures of 10-15 degrees C above the threshold. Heat stress is a major factor limiting crop productivity and adaptation, especially when extreme temperatures coincide with the critical stage of plant growth.. Heat stress is a major factor limiting crop productivity and adaptation, especially when extreme temperatures coincide with the critical stage of plant growth. Excessive heat can disrupt by denaturing enzymes and damaging metabolism so that changes occur in the morphological structure, phenology, physiology and molecular plants.The response to increase in temperature of 5-10 degrees C, makes plants produce a unique protein called heat shock proteins ( HSP). An increase in HSP production occurs when plants experience a sudden or gradual increase in temperature. HSP is released when the stress of exposed to plant. Under these conditions HSP is useful for protecting proteins and causes resistant plants. The resistance obtained by heat shock is different from the resistance obtained by rapid growth at moderately high temperatures. This difference is presumed by the presence of HSP responses induced by heat stress. The HSP can play a role as a sign of gene stress and activation and in regulating oxidation reactions in cells. Utilization of heat stress signaling in food crops breeding can be used to development Wheat Tolerance to High Temperature.

AB  - Characterizion of ambient thermal comfort using a standard heat index (HI) was performed for Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Phnom Penh, and Vientiane, with data covering 37 and 17 years for the first two and last two cities, respectively. HI was lower during the night and the early morning but high in the afternoon in both the dry and the wet seasons. Its diurnality showed a tendency to be more influenced by temperature than by relative humidity. The daily maximum heat index (DMHI) was the highest in April-May due to both warm and humid conditions, but was the lowest in December-January due to cool dry air. Among the five considered risk DMHI levels, "extreme caution" occurred the most often for the majority of the months, and "danger" occurrence tended to increase in April-June. Low-latitude cities (i.e., Bangkok and Phnom Penh) showed less pronounced diurnality and seasonality due to their proximity to the Equator and large water bodies. Increasing trends in seasonal DMHI average were found in Bangkok, Chiang Mai, and Vientiane; while decreasing trends in Phnom Penh were found in both seasons. The trends in seasonal DMHI extremes were consistent with those of the seasonal DMHI average in terms of direction (except Bangkok). Polynomial regression modeling, developed for trend factor attribution, suggests more influence of humidity than of temperature for most trends. Partial correlation analysis indicates seasonal DMHI average to be more associated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation than with the Indian Ocean Dipole.

AB  - Concerns about the health and safety of working populations as well as preventive actions to reduce heat-related illnesses and fatalities have intensified as global warming and heatwaves continue to rise as a result of climate change. This study aimed to translate and culturally-adapted the translated Malay version of the Heat Strain Score Index (HSSI) questionnaire so that it can be utilized as a screening tool for heat stress among the Malay-speaking outdoor workers. The original English version of HSSI underwent forward-backward translation and was cross-culturally adapted into the Malay language by bilingual translators based on established guidelines. The content validation was reviewed by a six-member expert committee including the representative of outdoor workers. Face validation was carried out among 10 outdoor workers involved with various work tasks. Psychometric analysis was conducted based on a cross-sectional study among 188 workers who were eligible. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was used for construct validity while internal consistency reliability was performed using Cronbach's alpha. The interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to calculate the test-retest reliability. Both content and face validity were acceptable with the overall content validity index being 1.00, while the universal face validity index was 0.83. The factor analysis using varimax rotation extracted four factors which explained 56.32% of the cumulative percentage of variance and factor loading ranging from 0.415 to 0.804. The internal consistency reliability was acceptable with Cronbach's alpha ranging from 0.705 to 0.758 for all the factors. The overall ICC value was 0.792 (95% CI; 0.764-0.801) which signifies good reliability. The findings from this study indicate that the Malay version of HSSI is a reliable and culturally-adapted instrument. Further validation is needed so that it can be used extensively assess the heat stress among susceptible Malay-speaking outdoor workers in Malaysia who are exposed to hot humid environments.

AB  - Understanding climate extremes and indices is crucial for addressing climate change impacts, including the increased variability in local weather patterns and extreme events. Previous studies on the Arabian Peninsula (AP) have been limited by sparse station data and restricted spatial coverage. To overcome this limitation, this paper aims to assess the spatial distribution and temporal trends of temperature and precipitation indices suggested by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) using ERA5 reanalysis data from 1951 to 2020 for the AP. Additionally, this study investigated the changes relative to the reference period (1951-1980). The modified Mann-Kendall test and Sen's Slope estimator are utilized to detect significant trends and estimate their magnitude. Results revealed that ERA5 was consistent with previous studies that utilized insitu station data, which offers a more detailed picture of the affected areas. The findings indicated a significant warming trend in temperature indices, with an increase of over 1degree celsius per decade observed across several areas, including the northern AP, and certain regions experiencing a discrepant change of 3 degree celsius increase compared to the reference period. Changes in rainfall indices indicate a shift in rainfall patterns from the AP's fertile southwest regions towards more intense patterns in specific eastern regions, including Oman, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. However, the precipitation temporal trends are weak in magnitude and variable spatially, with dominant decreases in both intensity (-10 mm per decade) and frequency indices (-5 days per decade). Some locations are subject to the combined effects of most heatwave indicators simultaneously, while flood indicators and yet others by drought indicators influence others. All these locations have been accurately identified in this study. The findings provide valuable information regarding the region's climate change vulnerability and adaptation needs.

AB  - Southeast Asia (SEA), a region climatologically important but limited by data availability, is suffering from serious scarceness of heat wave (HW) research. Using the observational and reanalysis data, we find that in most parts of SEA, HWs are becoming more frequent, longer-lasting, and stronger, and affect more land areas. The increasing trends of HW characteristics defined by minimum temperatures are larger than those by maximum temperatures, alarming a situation of anomalously warm night. Magnitude of yearly hottest HW event increases faster, and duration of yearly longest HW shows significant trends in more areas than their average counterparts. ERA5 reproduces well the HW trends defined by daily minimum temperatures, but underestimate those by maximum temperature. The data set CHIRTS improves on daily maximum temperature and associated HW trends, but deteriorates on daily minimum temperature. This study highlights the importance of high-quality data, either observational or reanalysis, on the HW study in SEA.

AB  - Nutmeg is an important spice and contributes significantly to the gross domestic product of Indonesia. The study examines the impact of climate change on Indonesia and the production of nutmeg over Banda Neira Island. For this, the outputs from high-resolution regional climate models under different representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), within the framework of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5/Coordinated Regional Climate Down-scaling Experiment-Coordinated Output for Regional Evaluations (CMIP5/CORDEX-CORE) over southeast Asia domain are employed. The representation of the spatial structure of rainfall and temperature climatology is found to be much better in ensembles as compared to individual model experiments. The behaviour of simulated rainfall and temperature from the model experiments is examined to check whether the projected climate favours an increase in nutmeg production. The study found that projected changes in the number of wet days (ideal 100-160 wet days), heavy rainfall events, rising mean temperature above the optimum temperature range (25-26 degrees C), increasing heatwave spells, and prolongation of the warm period led to an unfavourable climate for nutmeg production. Based on the analysis of dynamically produced (model simulated) climate variables, the study rejects the forecasted increase in nutmeg production using a statistical regression model due to the unfavourable climatic conditions that are likely to affect the growth, production and quality of nutmeg. The changing climate not only reduces regional agricultural production but also impacts the socio-economic condition of the people of Indonesia. Therefore, the study emphasizes implementing stringent climate laws and policies at global, regional and local levels to curb greenhouse gas emissions and reduce the negative impact of climate change.

AB  - This study assessed the combined influences of climate change and urbanization on land surface temperature (LST) and surface urban heat island (SUHI) in the Bangkok metropolitan region (BKK) and Ho Chi Minh City metropolitan area (HCM) during 1990-2020. We found climate change evidence from trends and variations of temperature extremes in both cities throughout the past three decades, especially for the significant upward trends of nighttime temperature in HCM (0.23 - 0.3 degrees C/decade). These cities have been undergoing rapid urbanization, in which HCM has a higher urbanization rate with an annual growth rate of 8.03%/year against BKK (4.26%/year). Landscape metrics have rapidly shifted towards urban aggregation and green space fragmentation along with urbanization. A peer comparison shows that BKK holds a greater urban size and LST intensity, while HCM leads in urban growth and SUHI magnitude. These changes jointly contribute to climbing SUHI intensity, especially the dramatic influence of surface changes. Yet, temperature extremes also play an indispensable role in regulating SUHI magnitude, in which the impact in HCM is considerable compared to the effect in BKK. The research findings provide crucial information for both cities - where incorporation of climate change resilience strategies and SUHI mitigation into the master plans for livable cities are recommended.

AB  - The bias correction method (BCM) is useful in reducing the statistically downscaled biases of global climate models' (GCM) outputs and preserving statistical moments of the hydrological series. However, BCM is less efficient under changed future conditions due to the stationary assumption and performs poorly in removing bias at extremes, thereby producing unreliable bias-corrected data. Thus, the existing BCM with normal distribution is improved by incorporating skewed distributions into the model with linear covariate (BCM-QM(skewed)). In this study, BCM-QM(skewed) is developed to reduce biases in the extreme temperature data of peninsular Malaysia. The input is the MIROC5 model output gridded data and observations sourced by the Malaysian Department of Irrigation and Drainage (1976-2005). BCM-QM(skewed) with log-normal (LGNORM) and Gumbel (GUM) has shown considerable skill in correcting biases, capturing extreme and nonstationarity of current and future extreme temperatures data series corresponding to the representative concentration pathways (RCPs) for 2006-2100 based on model diagnostics and precision analysis. Higher projection of extreme temperatures is more pronounced under RCP8.5 than RCP4.5 with precise estimates ranging from 33 to 42 degrees C and 30 to 32 degrees C, respectively. Finally, the projection of extreme temperatures is used to calculate cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality rate which coincides with high extreme temperatures ranging between 0.002 and 0.014.

AB  - Climate change-derived extreme heat phenomena are one of the major concerns across the globe, including Bangladesh. The appraisal of historical spatiotemporal changes and possible future changes in heat index (HI) is essential for developing heat stress mitigation strategies. However, the climate-health nexus studies in Bangladesh are very limited. This study was intended to appraise the historical and projected changes in HI in Bangladesh. The HI was computed from daily dry bulb temperature and relative humidity. The modified Mann-Kendal (MMK) test and linear regression were used to detect trends in HI for the observed period (1985-2015). The future change in HI was projected for the mid-century (2041-2070) for three Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios, RCP 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 using the Canadian Earth System Model Second Generation (CanESM2). The results revealed a monotonic rise in the HI and extreme caution conditions, especially in the humid summer season for most parts of Bangladesh for the observed period (1985-2015). Future projections revealed a continuous rise in HI in the forthcoming period (2041-2070). A higher and remarkable increase in the HI was projected in the northern, northeastern, and south-central regions. Among the three scenarios, the RCP 8.5 showed a higher projection of HI both in hot and humid summer compared to the other scenarios. Therefore, Bangladesh should take region-specific adaptation strategies to mitigate the impacts of HI.

AB  - A battery thermal management system (BTMS) plays a significant role in an electric vehicle (EV)'s battery pack to avoid the adverse effect of extreme heat being generated during application. A heat pipe-based BTMS is regarded as an alternative technique to maintain an optimum working temperature of the lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) used in EVs. In this study, the heat pipe-based BTMS was designed and experimented under high input power. The battery surrogate was sandwiched with L- and I-shaped heat pipes, and heated at 30, 40, 50 and 60 W. The heat pipes' condenser sections were cooled by water at 0.0167, 0.0333 and 0.05 kg/s. Findings revealed that the designed heat pipe-based BTMS could give the maximum temperature (T-max) below 55 degrees C, even at the highest input power, and provide the temperature difference (Delta T) below 5 degrees C. It exhibited capability to transfer more than 92.18% of the heat generated. Controlling the T-max and Delta T within the desirable range demonstrates that the heat pipe-based BTMS is viable and effective at higher heat loads.

AB  - This study aims to examine the relationship between daily temperature and mortality in the Klang Valley, Malaysia, over the period 2006-2015. A quasi-Poisson generalized linear model combined with a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was used to estimate the association between the mean temperature and mortality categories (natural n=69,542, cardiovascular n= 15,581, and respiratory disease n=10,119). Particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter below 10 mu m (PM10) and surface ozone (O-3) was adjusted as a potential confounding factor. The relative risk (RR) of natural mortality associated with extreme cold temperature (1st percentile of temperature, 25//.2 degrees C) over lags 0-28 days was 1.26 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00, 1.60), compared with the minimum mortality temperature (28.2 degrees C). The relative risk associated with extremely hot temperature (99th percentile of temperature, 30.2 degrees C) over lags 0-3 days was 1.09 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.17). Heat effects were immediate whereas cold effects were delayed and lasted longer. People with respiratory diseases, the elderly, and women were the most vulnerable groups when it came to the effects of extremely high temperatures. Extreme temperatures did not dramatically change the temperature-mortality risk estimates made before and after adjustments for air pollutant (PM10 and O-3) levels.

AB  - This research presents a detailed structure and time evolution for forming the passivation layer during oxidation of Selective Laser Melted (SLM-IN718) and commercially cast (Comm-IN718) Inconel 718 at 650 degrees C. It reveals that this layer has a complex 3D structure, with a top layer of Fe-Ni Chromite spinels (NiFexCr(2-x)O4) and a sublayer of Cr2O3. Raman maps and statistical analysis estimate x in NiFexCr(2-x)O4 for different heating times. The heating process initially forms iron-rich NiFexCr(2-x)O4 with x approximate to 2, decreasing to approximate to 1 after 72 h of heating for both Comm- and SLM-IN718. Interestingly, a slightly different result was observed for the heat-treated SLM sample (HTSLM-IN718), where x increased again to 1.2 and 1.4 after 72 h. Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) results reveal the depth hierarchy of the passivation layer profile, with the chromite layer covering a thicker Cr2O3 layer forming above the niobium-rich intermetallic layer above the alloy. Passivation layers are critical to the endurance of superalloys during extreme thermal cycling conditions. Therefore, by precisely determining the complex stoichiometry and hierarchy of the layer, this study can guide the development of durable superalloys with improved resistance to extreme thermal cycling conditions.

AB  - The health and economic impacts of extreme heat on humans are especially pronounced in populations without the means to adapt. We deployed a sensor network across 12 informal settlements in Makassar, Indonesia to measure the thermal environment that people experience inside and outside their homes. We calculated two metrics to assess the magnitude and frequency of heat stress conditions, wet bulb temperature and wet bulb globe temperature, and compared our in situ data to that collected by weather stations. We found that informal settlement residents experience chronic heat stress conditions, which are underestimated by weather stations. Wet bulb temperatures approached the uppermost limits of human survivability, and wet bulb globe temperatures regularly exceeded recommended physical activity thresholds, both in houses and outdoors. Under a warming climate, a growing number of people living informally will face potentially severe impacts from heat stress that have likely been previously overlooked or underestimated.

AB  - The gas-thermal inertia and power-gas-heat interdependency, as two fundamental features of the IES, play a crucial role in IES resilience during extreme events. This paper proposes a comprehensive resilience assessment framework to investigate the influence of these two factors on IES resilience performance during extreme events. Considering the inherent operational properties of power distribution system (PDS), natural gas system (NGS) and district heating system (DHS), the interactions among multiple sectors and gas-thermal inertia, a dynamic optimal energy flow model is established to simulate the IES cascading failures and restoration process under outage scenarios. On this basis, the multi-stage resilience curves for the IES as well as each subsystem are obtained. Regarding the geometric features of the resilience curves, a set of interdependency metrics is further proposed to quantify the sensitivity of NGS and DHS vulnerabilities that arise from their interdependency with PDS. Comparative experiments are conducted to analyze the influence of gas-thermal inertia and system interdependency on IES resilience. The results demonstrated the proposed metrics can effectively assess the spatial and temporal interdependency among the resilience of power, gas, and heat subsystems, providing useful information for operators in identifying critical links and evaluating potential upgrades to enhance the resilience of IES.

AB  - The rise in the frequency and magnitude of extreme temperature phenomena across the globe has led to the recurrent incidence of global climate hazards, which have had severe effects on socioeconomic development. The daily maximum and minimum temperature datasets of 27 sites in Bangladesh were used to detect spatiotemporal trends of temperature extremes over Bangladesh during 1980-2017 based on ten temperature extreme indices using multi-statistical modeling namely linear regression, Pearson correlation coefficient, and factor analyses. Besides, mutation analyses based on the Mann-Kendall test, Sen's slope estimator, and Pettit test were employed to show the changing trend in extreme temperature. Results show that except for warmest days, the warm indices showed an increasing trend, mainly since the 2000s, while the growth rate was faster, and the response to global climate warming was sensitive. The cold indices were demonstrated a reverse trend since the 2010s. Diurnal temperature range (DTR) and summer days (SU) increased faster, implying that the rising speed of daily max temperature was higher than of daily min-temperature in Bangladesh. The de-trended fluctuation analysis (DFA) revealed a continuous increase in temperature extreme in the future except for cold days. The probability distribution functions (PDF) analysis revealed an evident variation of the curves in recent decades compared to the past three decades. Besides the warm night, DTR and SU primarily control the general warming trend of temperature extremes over Bangladesh during the study period. The mutation of the warm indices occurred before the cold index, indicating that the warm indices were more sensitive to global climate warming. The temperature extremes recognized in our research suggest that elevated warm temperature extremes due to global climate warming may have huge implications on the sustainable development of Bangladesh in the forthcoming period.

AB  - To investigate the recent effects of climate change in the upper Geum River basin in South Korea, a detailed trend analysis of 17 extreme climate indices based on 33 years (1988-2020) of daily precipitation, and daily (minimum and maximum) temperature data has been analyzed in this study. Out of the 17 extreme climate indices, nine (eight) indices were based on temperature (precipitation) data. Trend analysis based on detailed temporal scales (annual, seasonal, monthly) were performed through the Mann-Kendall trend test and the Theil-Sen slope method. Furthermore, the Mann-Whitney-Pettit test was also applied in this study, to detect abrupt changes in the extreme climate indices. Based on the results of this study, the climate conditions at the upper Geum River basin for the past three decades can be summarized as follows: general increase in temperature intensity, decrease in cold duration, increased heat duration, increased precipitation intensity, and increased consecutive wet and dry durations. Furthermore, a prolonged summer season (shorter spring, and autumn periods) and precipitation shifts, were detected based on trend analysis results of seasonal, and monthly time scales. The results presented in this study can provide supplementary data for improving watershed management strategies in the upper Geum River basin.

AB  - Understanding the changes in temperature extremes is important for managing and coping with the risks associated with regional climate change. However, the climatological characteristics of temperature extremes and their variabilities is still not adequately studies in Malaysia. This study evaluates the spatial and temporal variations of temperature extremes over Malaysia for the period 1985-2018. This study includes four phases: (a) collection, quality control and homogeneity analysis of temperature data; (b) general (TXmean, TNmean, TMmean and DTR), warm (TXx, TNx, TX90p and TN90p) and cool (TXn, TNn, TX10p and TN10p) temperature extreme indices calculations; (c) trend analysis of temperature extremes using the Mann-Kendall and Sens's slope test; and (d) analyses of correlations between temperature extremes and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The results indicate a warming of surface temperature across Malaysia, particularly in Peninsular Malaysia. In general, TXmean, TNmean and TMmean increased significantly at 5% significance level by 0.12 degrees C/decade, 0.27 degrees C/decade and 0.17 degrees C/decade, respectively. A significant decreasing trend in DTR by 0.12 degrees C/decade is seen, which is related to the higher increasing rate of TNmean. All of the warm extreme indices, TXx, TNx, TX90p and TN90p presents significant increasing trends by 0.19 degrees C/decade, 0.28 degrees C/decade, 2.86%/decade and 3.08%/decade, respectively. For the cool extreme indices, TX10p and TN10p decreased significantly by 0.95%/decade and 3.18%/decade, respectively, though the trend in TXn by 0.11 degrees C/decade is not statistically significant. The only cool index presenting a significant increasing trend is TNn by 0.44 degrees C/decade, indicating a reduction of cool nights. Besides that, major cities in the northern and western parts of Peninsular Malaysia generally exhibit a higher warming trend compared to rural and highland area. These are possibly related to the intensified urban heat island effect under the rapid urbanization. This study also found that the ENSO affected warm extreme indices much stronger than cool extreme indices in Malaysia.

AB  - Due to lower core loss and higher flux density and permeability, thin non-oriented silicon steels are becoming more and more important for soft magnetic materials. Recently, laser has been emerged as a cost-effective tool for machining thin silicon steels, especially for the low-volume and high-variety motor manufacturing. Based on experimental data, this study aims at developing an extreme learning machine (ELM) for predicting the laser cutting qualifies of silicon steels with a thickness of 100 mu m. The three parameters considered were the laser power, cutting speed and pulse repetition rate and the two qualifies monitored were the kerf waviness and heat affected zone (HAZ). Each parameter was designated at four levels and totally 64 sets of experimental parameter were performed. Experimental results showed that both cutting qualifies were positively correlated with these three parameters. We randomly took 80% of the experimental data for model training while the remaining 20% was for model testing. To verify the ELM's appropriateness and advantage, two auxiliary models, artificial neural network and full quadratic multiple regression analysis (MRA), were also developed based on the same dataset for comparison. Results revealed that ELM well predicted waviness and HAZ and provided the most accurate predictions among the three models. The errors for waviness and HAZ were 2.90% and 4.16%, respectively. Consequently, the developed ELM was practical and effective for the waviness and HAZ estimations. Moreover, based on the random forests method, the relative significance of inputs associated with the responses was also addressed.

AB  - Braking efficiency is characterized by reduced braking time and distance, and therefore passenger safety depends on the design of the braking system. During the braking of a vehicle, the braking system must dissipate the kinetic energy by transforming it into heat energy. A too high temperature can lead to an almost total loss of braking efficiency. An excessive rise in brake temperature can also cause surface cracks extending to the outside edge of the drum friction surface. Heat transfer and temperature gradient, not to forget the vehicle's travel environment (high speed, heavy load, and steeply sloping road conditions), must thus be the essential criteria for any brake system design. The aim of the present investigation is to analyze the thermal behavior of different brake drum designs during the single emergency braking of a heavy-duty vehicle on a steeply sloping road. The calculation of the temperature field is performed in transient mode using a three-dimensional finite element model assuming a constant coefficient of friction. In this study, the influence of geometrical brake drum configurations on the thermal behavior of brake drums with two different materials in grey cast iron FG200 and aluminum alloy 356.0 reinforced with silicon carbide (SiC) particles is analyzed under extreme vehicle braking conditions. The numerical simulation results obtained using FE software ANSYS are qualitatively compared with the results already published in the literature.

AB  - Understanding extreme temperature variations is important for countries to manage risks associated with climate change. Yet, the characteristics of temperature extremes and possible climate change impacts have not been adequately investigated in Singapore. In this study, we attempted to do so by defining 14 extreme temperature indices (ETIs) for the period of 1982-2018 in Singapore, and investigating the trends of those ETIs using a pre-whitening Man-Kendall test coupled with the Sen's slope estimator method. The linear and nonlinear relationships between ETIs and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) were also examined using correlation, composite and wavelet analysis. Our results indicate that trends of temperature extremes varied according to station locations, ETIs and time scales. In all stations, ETIs such as the monthly mean value of the diurnal range between maximum and minimum temperatures (DTR), cool nights (TN10p) and cool days (TX10p) presented decreasing trends, while the rest of them exhibited increasing trends. The composite values varied for different ETIs-meaning that while eight no-threshold ETIs reflected smaller values, other ETIs reflected relatively larger composite values, indicating that ENSO may have affected those ETIs more. The ETIs were mainly statistically and significantly coherent with ENSO at a 2-8 year cycle.

AB  - Climate change has substantial effects on oil palm cultivation, such as changing soil moisture, more extreme weather events, altered monsoons, and heat stress, posing significant challenges to the industry's sustainability and productivity. The objective of this study is to examine the challenges posed by climate change on oil palm cultivation and its associated impacts, and to propose effective adaptation strategies to mitigate and address the adverse effects on oil palm cultivation. The findings indicate that soil moisture fluctuations have a substantial impact on both the yield and quality of oil palm fruit, underscoring the significance of effective soil moisture management. Altered monsoon patterns, characterized by irregular rainfall and extreme weather events, have detrimental effects on oil palm growth and productivity, necessitating the implementation of adaptation strategies. Heat stress further exacerbates the situation, as it diminishes photosynthesis, increases respiration rates, and induces water stress and premature aging in oil palm trees. Additionally, extreme weather events such as typhoons, hurricanes, and floods can inflict physical damage on oil palm plantations, leading to decreased yields and heightened production costs. To optimize oil palm growth and mitigate climate change impacts, implement agronomic adaptation strategies such as adjusting planting density, fertilizer application, irrigation, pruning, and pest and disease management. Invest in genetic adaptation by developing drought-tolerant, disease-resistant, and pest-resistant oil palm varieties. Promote land-use adaptation practices like crop rotation, intercropping, and agroforestry systems. Strengthen monitoring and early warning systems for extreme weather events. Encourage research and innovation for sustainable and climate-resilient practices, considering environmental and socio-economic implications.

AB  - In poikilothermic animals like fish, outbreaks of pathogen-related diseases are closely related with the temperature of the surrounding environment. Many salmonid fish species are thermally sensitive and therefore are especially endangered by thermal stress and habitat loss caused by increasing temperatures during summer heat waves. We hypothesized that combining thermal stress and the presence of a novel viral pathogen from for example aquaculture effluents may result in a potential host jump of the pathogen. This could be one of the mechanisms leading to an increased vulnerability of salmonids to a novel disease. Tilapia lake virus (TiLV) could be considered as one of the most dangerous emerging viruses affecting warm water aquaculture of Nile tilapia. This pathogen has a global reach with a yet to be defined host range. The aim of this study was to assess the potential for TiLV to infect salmonid hosts in a range of water temperatures which can be reached during summer heatwaves in Continental Europe. For this, it was established that TiLV can replicate in vitro in salmonid cells over the wide temperature range of 15 degrees C to 25 degrees C. The susceptibility of rainbow trout and brown trout juveniles to infection with TiLV was investigated in infection trials based on cohabitation and on intraperitoneal injection of the virus in elevated water temperatures of 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C. These experiments showed that if the ability of the virus to enter the organism is considered, the susceptibility of rainbow and brown trout to the virus is low. The exposure of these salmonids to the virus by cohabitation did not lead to high virus loads in the liver and brain. However, the permissivity, i.e. the ability of the virus to replicate in the fish body, is high, because IPinjections of TiLV led to a high virus replication in internal organs. Therefore, TiLV could have some pathogenic potential in salmonids which might be exacerbated by climate change and anthropogenic activities.

AB  - One of the functions of a brake system is to reduce or maintain the speed of a vehicle. The braking process generally converts kinetic energy into heat. While a direct contact brake system functions using friction, a non-contact brake system such as an eddy current brake (ECB) relies on eddy currents. As repeated braking increases the temperature of the brake components, it decreases performance and, in extreme cases, can result in brake failure. In an ECB system, heat typically accumulates in the conductor material used to generate the braking force. When a conductor material is repeatedly subjected to excessive heat, its properties change affecting braking performance. This has prompted to the use of liquid- and air-based cooling in ECB systems, both of which have their respective advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, this present review extensively investigates the potential of using these refrigerants in various types of ECB systems.

AB  - In near-future climate change scenarios, elevated ocean temperatures with higher and more frequent peaks are anticipated than at present. Moreover, increased eutrophication and higher primary and secondary productivity will affect the oxygen levels of shallow-water coastal ecosystems, creating hypoxic conditions that can be experienced regularly, especially in dense vegetated systems. These climate-related events may impose detrimental effects on the primary productivity of seagrass. To evaluate such effects, this study combined gas exchange measurements with pulse amplitude-modulated fluorometry to assess the impact of short-time exposure to a range of water temperatures at ambient and low-oxygen levels on mitochondria] respiration, chlorophyll fluorescence (based on the F-v/F-0 ratio), photosynthetic oxygen evolution, and photorespiration in leaf segments of the temperate seagrass Zostera marina and the tropical seagrass Thalassia hemprichii. We found that mitochondria] respiration in both Z. marina and T. hemprichii increased with higher temperatures up to 40 degrees C and that low O-2 caused significantly reduced respiration rates, particularly in T. hemprichii. Elevated water temperature had a clear negative effect on the F-v/F-0 of both seagrass species, indicating damage or inactivation of the photosynthetic apparatus, even when light is not present. Moreover, damage to the photosynthetic apparatus was observed as an effect of elevated temperature combined with low O-2 during darkness, resulting in subsequent lower photosynthesis in light. Photorespiration was present, but not promoted by increased temperature alone and will thus not further contribute to productivity losses during warmer events (when not carbon limited). This study demonstrates the negative impact of hypoxic stress and elevated temperatures on seagrass productivity, which may influence the overall health of seagrass plants as well as oxygen and carbon fluxes of shallow-water coastal ecosystems in warmer climate scenarios.

AB  - Temporal variation of mixed-layer heat budget at two contrasting locations, namely, western Pacific (warm water pool) and eastern Pacific (cold tongue) during the extreme El Nino phenomenon in 2015/2016 is evaluated. Oceanic and atmospheric datasets, including sea surface temperature (SST), wind stress, shortwave radiation (SWR), longwave radiation, latent heat flux (LHF), and sensible heat flux are analyzed. A slight warming occurred in the eastern tropical Pacific associated with a positive SST anomaly, which reflected the weakening or reversal of the trade winds. Meanwhile, the western tropical Pacific exhibited a cooling tendency during the development phase of El Nino. Analysis of the mixed-layer heat budget shows that the net heat flux due to SWR and LHF significantly contributes to the warming of the eastern tropical Pacific. The contribution from horizontal advection was extremely small on both sides. The analysis shows that the residual term significantly contributes to cooling ( warming) tendency observed in the western (eastern) tropical Pacific. This condition may suggest that residual process due to entrainment and diffusivity played an important role in the evolution of cooling (warming) process in the western (eastern) tropical Pacific.

AB  - Gaseous emissions have contributed to global warming, an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events and poorer air quality. The associated health impacts have been well reported in temperate regions. In Singapore, key climate change adaptation measures and activities include coastal and flood protection, and mitigating heat impacts. We systematically reviewed studies examining climate variability and air quality with population health in Singapore, a tropical city-state in South-East Asia (SEA), with the aim to identify evidence gaps for policymakers. We included 14 studies with respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular outcomes, foodborne disease and dengue. Absolute humidity (3 studies) and rainfall (2 studies) were positively associated with adverse health. Extreme heat (2 studies) was inversely associated with adverse health. The effects of mean ambient temperature and relative humidity on adverse health were inconsistent. Nitrogen dioxide and ozone were positively associated with adverse health. Climate variability and air quality may have disease-specific, differing directions of effect in Singapore. Additional high quality studies are required to strengthen the evidence for policymaking. Research on effective climate action advocacy and adaptation measures for community activities should be strengthened.

AB  - Heat stress, resulting from global warming, is considered one of the major challenges to be addressed for increasing plant survival and productivity worldwide. Although plants have a built-in defense mechanism against heat stress, such strategy seems to be insufficient to counteract heat adversities under extreme temperature regimes. Hence, increasing heat tolerance in plants for sustainable yields is one of the biggest challenges for researchers in the coming decades. Conventional plant breeding approach to enhance heat tolerance has gained some successes; however, more efforts are needed to make plants resilient to heat stress for increasing crop production during ongoing climate change. Thus, exploring `heat stress mitigation strategies' using cost-effective and eco-friendly approaches may be quick and sustainable alternatives. The use of silicon (Si) and Sinanoparticles (Si-NPs) in enhancing heat tolerance in plants has recently gained much attention. Application of Si and Si-NPs can assist plants to overcome heat-induced oxidative stress through the acceleration of reactive oxygen species detoxification by modulating the antioxidant systems and regulating transcription of key genes associated with heat stress responses. In fact, molecular rationale behind Si-mediated heat tolerance in plants is largely unknown. In this minireview, we made efforts to understand the mechanistic aspects of heat-induced responses and damages in plants, and possible molecular dynamics of Si-induced heat tolerance in plants. We also highlighted recent advances on how Si induces heat tolerance potential in plants and future perspectives on how Si can contribute to sustainable crop production under the increasing threat of global climate change.

AB  - Introduction: Heat stress is a physical hazard and a potential health risk which can result in various conditions ranging from discomfort, headaches, psychological disorders, heat stroke and even death in extreme cases. Factors which cause heat stress include high ambient temperature, limited air movement, strenuous physical work and direct exposure to the heat of the engine/sun. Continuous heat stress, exacerbated by dehydration, can lead to kidney disease. This study is a literature review conducted to explore factors that influence heat stress and the relationship of heat stress with acute kidney disease and chronic kidney disease.
   Methods: Literature search was conducted in September 2021. Research sources were taken from several databases, namely Science Direct, ProQuest, PubMed, and Google Scholar. From the databases, 23,316 articles were from Science Direct, 140,319 articles were from ProQuest, 670 articles were from PubMed, and 288,000 articles were from Google Scholars. Out of the total database only 24 articles met the inclusion criteria. The variables in this study were heat stress, acute kidney disease, and chronic kidney disease.
   Results: This literature review shows that several factors which can affect heat stress are heat exposure, workload, rehydration, and rest period arrangements. Heat stress experienced by workers can cause decreased kidney function and chronic kidney disease. Heat stress conditions that are continuously experienced by workers can cause chronic kidney disease.
   Conclusion: Heat stress can be experienced by workers due to heat exposure, heavy workload, poor rehydration, and poor rest period arrangements. Heat stress can cause acute kidney disease and chronic kidney disease.

AB  - Short-duration extreme rainfall events are the main trigger of flash and pluvial floods in cities. Depending on the local climate zone and urban fabric that affect meteorological variables such as air temperature, humidity, and aerosol concentration, the built environment can either intensify or reduce extreme rainfall intensity. This study examined how urbanization in a large metropolitan area characterized by open low-rise buildings, affected sub-daily extreme rainfall intensities over the period between 2000 and 2018. The research was conducted in the metropolitan region of Phoenix, Arizona, which is supported by a large and dense rain-gauge network (168 stations). The built area increased by 6% between 2001 and 2016 and the number of residences by 300,000. Over the study period, sub-daily extreme rainfall intensities intensified both in the urbanized area and in its rural surroundings but the intensification trend within the built area was considerably larger (3 times larger). We calculated a negative trend in aerosol concentration (-0.005 AOD y(-1)) but a positive trend in near-surface air temperature that was considerably larger in the urban areas (0.15 degrees C y(-1)) as compared to the rural counterpart (0.09 degrees C y(-1)) for the period between 2005 and 2018. Although built surfaces and open low-rise buildings contributed to an increase in air temperature, they did not affect air humidity. Changes in rainfall extremes approximately follow the Clausius-Clapeyron relation within the urban area with an increase at a rate of 7% degrees C-1. These results demonstrate that the warming effect associated with a low-rise urban area can cause an intensification of sub-daily rainfall extremes that is significantly larger than in nearby rural areas.

AB  - This paper studies the technical feasibility of a novel solar roof tile (SRT) to be used for HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) in buildings. The SRT utilizes a phase change material (PCM) for thermal storage. The SRT works like a conventional thermal storage tank while featuring compact size and lower cost. Two heat exchangers are connected one each on the top and bottom of the PCM matrix. The top heat exchanger functions as an absorber of solar heat. Aqueous sodium hydroxide passes to the top heat exchanger from a storage sump. The bottom heat exchanger is the condenser and evaporator with water passing through the heat exchanger. The cooling system is integrated inside the customised roof tile interlocking system. This system uses roof tiles that have higher performance during extreme weather conditions and lower maintenance costs. In this paper, we have investigated the thermal performance and technical feasibility of the proposed solar SRT-HVAC system. This proposition eliminates conventional thermal storage tanks used in solar thermal collectors. The dynamic performance of the SRT under transient conditions is evaluated using the TRNSYS modelling package, which shows the influence of design variables like insulation points and charging/discharging durations on thermal storage performance.

AB  - Heat waves are unusually high temperature events over consecutive days and may cause adverse impacts such as morbidity and mortality. The interaction between heat waves and urban heat island (UHI) effects has remained a subject of debate, as some studies prove heat wave-UHI synergy while others do not. Furthermore, heat waves affect tropical cities more severely than mid-latitude cities, but there is a disproportionate lack of heat wave studies focusing on tropical cities. We attempt to narrow this gap by studying the heat wave in Singapore in April 2016 using ground observations and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Compared to non-heat wave days, the ground observations show that daytime temperatures can be 3 degrees C higher during the heat wave. Despite the temperature spike, the UHI intensity is not amplified during the heat wave, maintaining its peak near 2.5 degrees C during both heat wave and non-heat wave periods. WRF simulation results also agree well with measurements and predict UHI peaks near 2.5 degrees C during both periods, showing no heat wave-UHI synergy. The spatially averaged UHI intensity also shows no such synergy. There is no significant change of wind speed, soil moisture availability or heat storage flux during the heat wave. Therefore, the lack of heat wave-UHI synergy in our study is consistent with current understanding of factors contributing to UHI. This study shows that the heat wave-UHI interaction in a tropical city can be different from that in cities in the temperate climate zone and more studies should be conducted in tropical cities, which are projected to suffer larger impacts of increasing heat stress.

AB  - Extension of the tube wall's heat transfer area and mixing nanoparticles with working fluids are the most effective and potential techniques to enhance the heat transfer rate, which is required to remove the excessive load of heat from the heat transfer apparatus. These extreme loads are dangerous threats for heat transfer equipment, which may cause several damages. Therefore, a corrugated pipe was studied numerically along with SWCNT-water nanofluid, to determine the improvement of laminar convective heat transfer rate. Ansys fluent software and steady-state control volume method were applied for simulation purposes. Hence, different volume fractions (1% - 5%) of nanoparticles were considered to mix with water to produce nanofluid. A range of Reynolds numbers from 500 to 1200 with a constant wall heat flux of 1000 W/m2 was considered to calculate the heat transfer rate. Additionally, the corresponding pumping power requirement for such improvements was also calculated. The result demonstrated that by increasing the Reynolds number, the Nusselt number and heat transfer coefficient were raised significantly for a corrugated pipe compared to a plain pipe. Consequently, the presence of nanoparticles in the working fluid also showed more enhancement. For the corrugated pipe, at Re =500, SWCNTwater nanofluid showed a maximum 56.52% enhancement of Nusselt number and heat transfer coefficient. Furthermore, SWCNT-water nanofluid showed a pumping power advantage (92% for 5% volume fraction). Additionally, correlations to calculate the Nusselt number and heat transfer coefficient of nanofluid were also developed, which showed good agreement with numerical results. However, it can be concluded that corrugated channels, along with nanofluid, provide enhancement of heat transfer rate, Nusselt number, and pumping power advantage for the laminar developed region of a pipe.

AB  - Buildings play a significant role in indoor and outdoor exposure to heat in urban areas. In this study, we quantify the heat mitigation potential of typical building energy efficiency measures that are often not considered as urban heat mitigation strategies, such as added insulation. We combined whole-building energy and urban climate simulations to compare indoor and outdoor (pedestrian-level) heat exposure with different levels of energy efficiency and under different climate timeframes in a soon-to-be-built public housing project in Phoenix, AZ. We found that improved energy efficiency reduces indoor and outdoor exposure to heat while climate change increases both. Considering the 2018 version of the energy code as the baseline, the mitigating impact of upgrading energy efficiency on indoor exposure to heat (as defined by% of year Tindoor > Tcooling setpoint +1(degrees) C) exceeded the increase caused by climate change. Our estimates show a 6.6% increase caused by climate change vs. 20.7% reduction due to improved efficiency. Furthermore, our results indicate that energy upgrades may also have an impact on outdoor heat exposure (as defined by% of year with Toutdoor> 40 C-degrees) due to reduced heat emitted from the buildings and their HVAC systems. We found a 2% increase in exposure caused by climate change vs. 1.4% reduction due to by improved efficiency. This suggest that upgrading energy efficiency of buildings may at least partially offset the impact of climate change on outdoor exposure to heat in the modelled urban canyon.

AB  - This paper documents the environmentally induced behavioral biases in the land market and shows how buyers correct their biases by learning from repeated transactions. Using a sample of government land sales along two sides of the heating service line in China, we first show land parcels transacted in the south in the winter are associated with an average price discount of 7.1%, compared to transactions in the north where heating service is provided. We discuss three possible explanations, including projection bias, incorrect belief, and salience bias. We find adverse weather such as low temperature and extreme weather may trigger the mispricing in the absence of the heating service, lending support to the projection bias. Moreover, our empirical investigations suggest the local government, as the only land seller, responds weakly to such biases. We also provide suggestive evidence that individual buyers in the south can learn from prior experience.

AB  - Diabetes is a major public health problem globally, and heat exposure may be a potential risk factor for death among diabetes. This study examines the association between heat and diabetes mortality in different regions of Thailand and investigates whether heat effects are modified by regional greenness. Daily temperature and daily diabetes deaths data were obtained for 60 provinces of Thailand during 2000-2008. A case-crossover analysis was conducted to quantify the odds of heat-related death among diabetes. Meta-regression was then used to examine potential modification effects of regional greenness (as represented by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) on heat-related mortality. A strong association between heat and diabetes mortality was found in Thailand, with important regional variations. Nationally, the pooled odds ratio of diabetes mortality was 1.10 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-1.14) for heat (90th percentile of temperature) and 1.20 (95% CI: 1.10-1.30) for extreme heat (99th percentile of temperature) compared with the minimum mortality temperature, across lag 0-1 days. Central and northeast Thailand were the most vulnerable regions. Regional greenness modified the effects of heat, with lower mortality impacts in areas of higher levels of greenness. In conclusion, heat exposure increases mortality risk in diabetes, with large geographical variations in risk suggesting the need for region-specific public health strategies. Increasing greenness levels may help to reduce the burden of heat on diabetes in Thailand against the backdrop of a warming climate. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Jakarta's environmental problems, the increasing temperature, and the intensifying urban heat island effect (UHIE) add weight to the deteriorating quality of life in the city. Nevertheless, chronic exposure to heat, especially experienced by inhabitants in tropical cities, receives less attention. It is often seen as a low-onset event that requires no immediate action and is not as noticeable and apparent as other heat events, such as heat waves. This slow onset environmental hazard disproportionately affects the population in the lower socio-economic condition. With their low access to cooling infrastructure, the disadvantaged people of Jakarta live and work in an environment prone to extreme heat exposure. Poor urban planning and design contribute to the intensifying urban heat in Jakarta and exacerbate the impacts of heat by providing mitigating and managing urban heat in the city. Using the Multiple Stream Framework (MSF) lenses, we analyse how and why the issue of urban heat is currently being prioritized in Jakarta and how the provision of green open space contributes to thermal justice in Jakarta. The issue is examined by analyzing urban planning policy through government strategy documents and interviews with key stakeholders. The findings reveal that while there is a growing awareness of urban heat issues in Jakarta, they are often overshadowed by other strategic issues in the policy arena. The research underscores the significance of incorporating urban heat issues into urban policy agendas and promoting equitable distribution of green open space in Jakarta.

AB  - One of the effective thermochemical properties in the determination of heat process efficiency is the combustion enthalpy changes during complete combustion of the compounds. According to the importance of this property in different processes, the main aim of this work is selected as the development of extreme learning machine (ELM) approach to predict the combustion enthalpy in terms of functional groups. To achieve this goal, a comprehensive data set containing 4,590 experimental enthalpy points is used for the preparation and validation of ELM. To investigate the accuracy of the ELM approach in the estimation of the enthalpy, various visual and statistical comparisons are used. These comparisons lead into R (2) value of one and low error values for overall phase. The standard deviation, root mean squared error, and mean relative error for overall phase are determined to be 11.18, 14.92, and 0.28, respectively. The relative deviations between the estimated and actual enthalpy points are below 8%. According to the statistical and graphical results, ELM algorithm has great potential in the prediction of enthalpy of combustion for pure chemical materials.

AB  - Radiative cooling, taking advantage of the coldness of the sky, has a potential to be a sustainable alternative to meet cooling needs. The performance of a radiative cooling device is fundamentally limited by the emissivity of the sky, therefore depends heavily on the regional weather conditions. Although the sky emissivity is known to increase with the dew point temperature, the feasibility of radiative cooling remains elusive in the equatorial tropical climate, where the weather is humid, cloudy, and constantly changing. It is pointed out that a high degree of thermal insulation of the radiative cooling system can be effective under such extreme weather conditions. A new method to characterize dynamic sky conditions is presented, namely to measure the sky window emissivity in the zenith direction. It is shown that a sub-ambient cooling up to 8 degrees C is possible during daytime and that the cloud base is not a complete blackbody and can be used as a heat sink for radiative cooling.
   The feasibility of radiative cooling in hot and humid climates has been elusive, due to the opaqueness of the sky and the high cloud coverage. To overcome these compromising environmental factors, various heat gain channels are meticulously suppressed and 8 degrees temperature reduction from ambient is demonstrated during the daytime under the cloudy sky of Singapore.image (c) 2024 WILEY-VCH GmbH

AB  - Recently, biomass sources are important for energy applications. There is need for analyzing of the biomass model based on different components such as carbon, ash, and moisture content since the biomass sources are important for energy applications. In this paper, an extreme learning machine (ELM) is used to estimate efficiency. ELM was implemented for single-layer feed-forward neural network (SLFN) architectures. Because biomass modeling could be a very challenging task for conventional mathematical, it is suitable to apply machine learning models which could overcome nonlinearities of the process. The main attempt in this study was to develop a machine learning model for prediction of the higher heating values of biomass based on proximate analysis. According the prediction accuracy (coefficient of determination and root mean square error) of the higher heating value of the biomass, the inputs' influence was determined on the higher heating value. According to the obtained results, fixed carbon has less moderate coefficient, ash has less correlation coefficient, and volatile matter has the most correlation coefficient. Therefore, the volatile matter percentage weight has the highest relevance on the higher heating value of the biomass. On the contrary, the ash has the smallest relevance on the higher heating value of the biomass based on machine learning approach.

AB  - Thailand is a tropical country affected by global climate change and has high temperatures and humidity that cause heat stress in livestock. A temperature-humidity index (THI) is required to assess and evaluate heat stress levels in livestock. One of the livestock types in Thailand experiencing heat stress due to extreme climate change is crossbred dairy cattle. Genetic evaluations of heat tolerance in dairy cattle have been carried out for reproductive traits. Heritability values for reproductive traits are generally low (<0.10) because environmental factors heavily influence them. Consequently, genetic improvement for these traits would be slow compared to production traits. Positive and negative genetic correlations were found between reproductive traits and reproductive traits and yield traits. Several selection methods for reproductive traits have been introduced, i.e., the traditional method, marker-assisted selection (MAS), and genomic selection (GS). GS is the most promising technique and provides accurate results with a high genetic gain. Single-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP) has higher accuracy than the multi-step equivalent for fertility traits or low-heritability traits.

AB  - Heat Shock Protein 101 (HSP101), the homolog of Caseinolytic Protease B (CLPB) proteins, has functional conservation across species to play roles in heat acclimation and plant development. In wheat, several TaHSP101/CLPB genes were identified, but have not been comprehensively characterized. Given the complexity of a polyploid genome with its phenomena of homoeologous expression bias, detailed analysis on the whole TaCLPB family members is important to understand the genetic basis of heat tolerance in hexaploid wheat. In this study, a genome-wide analysis revealed thirteen members of TaCLPB gene family and their expression patterns in various tissues, developmental stages, and stress conditions. Detailed characterization of TaCLPB gene and protein structures suggested potential variations of the sub-cellular localization and their functional regulations. We revealed homoeologous specific variations among TaCLPB gene copies that have not been reported earlier. A study of the Chromosome 1 TaCLPB in four wheat genotypes demonstrated unique patterns of the homoeologous gene expression under moderate and extreme heat treatments. The results give insight into the strategies to improve heat tolerance by targeting one or some of the TaCLPB genes in wheat.

AB  - Monitoring temperature-dependent events is critical for understanding their dynamics since these events have an impact on both animal and human habitation. It is common to see analysis of heat index and sea level that are described separately although these events have a direct connection to temperature. Often these analyses are less effective and less reliable in describing its dynamics vis-a-vis redundancy, flexibility, accounting of uncertainties and optimization. Since both are temperature-dependent events, a unified stochastic model with memory was derived. These events can be effectively described with a collective memory function (T - t) mu-1/2 e -beta/2t t mu+1/2, modifying the Brownian motion. A good match between the empirical and theoretical MSDs for both heat index and sea level was obtained with memory parameters mu(HI) = 1.0460 and mu(SL) = 1.0894, respectively. With mu > 1, heat index and sea level exhibited long-term memory characteristics which have important implications for large timescale prediction. Similarly, analyses using a unified model are simplified and may provide the interrelatedness of these events.

AB  - With the ongoing rapid urbanisation, humans enjoy the comfort of living with the use of advanced technology and infrastructure, without consideration towards the pollution produced daily, such as waste, heat, and exhaust gas emissions. Human-induced climate change has resulted in extreme weather and climate events, causing a consequential increase in the urban heat island effect. A large amount of radiant heat is focused in the city area, threatening the threshold of comfort in urban living, affecting our future generations to come. Therefore, this paper discusses how this phenomenon could be mitigated through a few design approaches. The existence of green roofs helps reduce the direct absorption of heat in buildings while water bodies help lower the surrounding temperature of a place. Additionally, using high reflectivity and spectral emissivity materials in buildings can also lower heat absorption into a building. Also, the design of urban wind corridors increases airflow into an area, hence cooling the surrounding temperature. When these steps are strategically incorporated into a design, the amount of heat could be significantly reduced, hence extenuating the urban heat island effect. However, more in-depth research is needed to ensure that it could successfully palliate the urban heat island effect in a city. It is hoped that this study could be a comprehensive guide to designers and engineers, or any individuals in the field of architecture and urban design in tackling the problem, hence achieving their target in eliminating the urban heat island effect in future works.

AB  - Global gridded data sets of observed extremes indices underpin assessments of changes in climate extremes. However, similar efforts to enable the assessment of indices relevant to different sectors of society have been missing. Here we present a data set of sector-specific indices, based on daily station data, that extends the HadEX3 data set of climate extremes indices. These additional indices, which can be used singly or in combinations, have been recommended by the World Meteorological Organization and are intended to empower decision makers in different sectors with accurate historical information about how sector-relevant measures of the climate are changing, especially in regions where in situ daily temperature and rainfall data are hard to come by. The annual and/or monthly indices have been interpolated on to a 1.875(degrees)x 1.25(degrees) longitude-latitude grid for 1901-2018. We show changes in globally-averaged time series of these indices in comparison with reanalysis products. Changes in temperature-based indices are consistent with global scale warming, with days with Tmax > 30 degrees C (TXge30) increasing virtually everywhere with potential impacts on crop fertility. At the other end of the scale, the number of days with Tmin < -2(degrees)C (TNltm2) are reducing, decreasing potential damage from frosts. Changes in heat wave characteristics show increases in the number, duration and intensity of these extreme events in most places.

AB  - The braking system is one of the most important components of a vehicle. In general, the brakes will generate heat due to the braking process. The heat generated must be released into the environment to maintain braking performance at optimal conditions. In extreme conditions, braking will fail. The braking system can be developed as a braking support system is a non-contact braking system. One form of the non-contact braking system is the eddy current brake (ECB). ECB is an electric braking system with the principle of eddy current. In the ECB, overheating will result in decreased performance. The approach that can be taken to determine braking performance during heat generation is the modeling process using FEM. This study uses FEM to analyze the heat generated during braking. In addition to using FEM, research was carried out using experiments as a comparison. Analysis of heat generation in braking is needed to determine whether braking with ECB can be a backup and its potential as a substitute for friction brakes. The results show that the ECB heat generation event that affects the temperature rise reduces the braking torque performance. Research indicates that when overheating occurs, braking performance will decrease by up to 10% when the disk surface temperature rises more than 20 degrees C. It shows the importance of managing heat that occurs in the ECB.

AB  - Pin -fin cooling has long been a crucial technique employed in gas turbine blades to manage the extreme thermal conditions experienced during operation. While numerous studies have investigated the heat transfer characteristics of different pin-fin configurations, the substantial impact of the endwall of the cooling channel on the heat transfer capability of turbine blades has not received adequate attention or thorough investigation. This research paper focuses on studying the influence of a novel geometry, termed C-shaped-recessed endwall, on pin-fin cooling channels in gas turbine blades. The primary objective of this investigation is to analyze the vortex formation and its impact on heat transfer characteristics within the cooling system. The study involved testing five different pin-fin arrays with C-shaped-recessed endwalls inserted between them, spanning a Reynolds number range of 7400 to 36000. The results show that with reference geometrical values, the new geometry increases the Heat Transfer Efficiency Index (HTEI) by 36.53 % compared to the flat endwall at Re = 29000. Higher heat transfer capacities were achieved by manipulating the C-shaped-recessed endwall heights and width of indentations, and the peak HTEI recorded an increase of 49.75 % at Re = 29000 compared to the flat endwall. The findings from this study underscore the potential of the C-shaped-recessed endwall geometry to improve the heat transfer capability of pin -fins by optimizing endwall configurations.

AB  - Extreme changes in weather including heat-wave and high-temperature fluctuations are predicted to increase in intensity and duration due to climate change. Wheat being a major staple crop is under severe threat of heat stress especially during the grain-filling stage. Widespread food insecurity underscores the critical need to comprehend crop responses to forthcoming climatic shifts, pivotal for devising adaptive strategies ensuring sustainable crop productivity. This review addresses insights concerning antioxidant, physiological, molecular impacts, tolerance mechanisms, and nanotechnology-based strategies and how wheat copes with heat stress at the reproductive stage. In this study stress resilience strategies were documented for sustainable grain production under heat stress at reproductive stage. Additionally, the mechanisms of heat resilience including gene expression, nanomaterials that trigger transcription factors, (HSPs) during stress, and physiological and antioxidant traits were explored. The most reliable method to improve plant resilience to heat stress must include nanobiotechnology-based strategies, such as the adoption of nano-fertilizers in climate-smart practices and the use of advanced molecular approaches. Notably, the novel resistance genes through advanced molecular approach and nanomaterials exhibit promise for incorporation into wheat cultivars, conferring resilience against imminent adverse environmental conditions. This review will help scientific communities in thermo-tolerance wheat cultivars and new emerging strategies to mitigate the deleterious impact of heat stress.

AB  - A consequence of urbanization was the intensification of urban heat islands, especially in tropical cities. There have been rapid developments in infrastructure that have displaced open spaces. Meanwhile, Indonesia has a tropical climate directly affected by climate change. A high priority has been placed on adaptation measures to address issues such as sea-level rise, increased extreme weather, and threats to ecosystems and biodiversity. There is still a lack of specific knowledge regarding tropical climate in urban areas. In this paper, the author examines how building and urban planning affect urban heat islands in the tropics. According to the review, early planning and building based on local weather data can reduce the energy consumption and minimize the UHI effect. Furthermore, a media campaign and early education should increase awareness about adaptation measures between governments and citizens. Based on the findings from this study, some recommendations are offered for future urban planning, especially for tropical climates, to reduce UHI effects.

AB  - We present a general microscopic first-principles method to study the Coulomb-interaction-mediated heat transfer in the near field. Using the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, we derive Caroli formulas for heat transfers between materials with translational invariance. The central physical quantities are the screened Coulomb potential and the spectrum function of polarizability. Within the random phase approximation, we calculate the polarizability using the linear response density functional theory and obtain the screened Coulomb potential from a retarded Dyson equation. We show that the heat transfer mediated by the Coulomb interaction is consistent with that of the p-polarized evanescent waves which dominate the heat transfer in the near field. We adopt single-layer graphene as an example to calculate heat transfers between two parallel sheets separated by a vacuum gap d. Our results show a saturation of heat flux at the extreme near field which is different from the reported 1/d dependence for local response functions. The calculated heat flux is up to 5 x 10(4) times more than the blackbody limit, and a 1/d(2) dependence is shown at large separations. From the spectrum of energy current density, we infer that the near-field enhancement of heat transfer stems from electron transitions around the Fermi energy. With a uniform strain, the heat flux increases for most of the distances, while a negative correlation is shown at the moderate field. Our method is valid for inhomogeneous materials in which the macroscopic response function used in conventional theory of fluctuational electrodynamics would fail at the subnanometer scale.

AB  - Objectives: Global warming and more intense heat wave periods impact health. Heat illness during heat waves has not been studied in the prehospital setting of a low- and middle-income country (LMIC). Early intervention in the community and in the prehospital setting can improve outcomes. Hence, this paper aims to describe the characteristics of heat illness patients utilizing the ambulance service in Telangana state, India with the aim of optimizing public prevention and first aid strategies and prehospital response to this growing problem. Methods: This retrospective observational study reviewed patients presenting to Telangana's prehospital emergency care system with heat illness symptoms during the heat wave period from March through June in 2018 and 2019. Descriptive analysis was done on the prehospital, dispatch, and environmental data looking at the patients' characteristics and prehospital intervention. Results: There were 295 cases in 2018 and 230 cases in 2019 from March-June. The overall incidence of calls with heat illness symptoms was 1.5 cases per 100,000 people. The Scheduled Tribes (ST) had the highest incidence of 4.5 per 100,000 people. Over 96% were from the white income group (below poverty line) while two percent were from the pink income group (above poverty line). From geospatial mapping of the cases, the highest incidence of calls came from the rural, tribal areas. However, the time to response in rural areas was longer than that in an urban area. Males with an average age of 47 were more likely to be affected. The three most common symptoms recorded by the first responders were vomiting (44.4%), general weakness (28.7%), and diarrhea (15.9%). The three most common medical interventions on scene were oxygen therapy (35.1%), oral rehydration salt (ORS) solution administration (26.9%), and intravenous fluid administration (27.0%), with cold sponging infrequently mentioned. Conclusion: This descriptive study provides a snapshot of the regions and groups of people most affected by heat illness during heat waves and the heterogeneous symptom presentation and challenges with management in the prehospital setting. These data may aid planning of prehospital resources and preparation of community first responders during heat wave periods.

AB  - Marine farmers have reported increased incidence of mass mortalities of New Zealand green-lipped mussels, Perna canaliculus, grown on near-shore long-line aquaculture farms. While the causative agents remain unknown, die-off events typically occur during the warmest months of the austral summer and appear correlated to unprecedented summer marine heatwaves that have impacted the eastern Tasman Sea in recent years. To further elucidate the role of chronic heat stress as a predisposing factor to 'summer mortality', adult P. canaliculus were incubated at 17, 21 and 24 degrees C for 13 months. Overall biological performance was impacted in the elevated temperature treatments; mean mass gain (Specific Growth Rate) at 17 degrees C was 0.21% day(-1), but fell to 0.18% day(-1) at 21 degrees C and 0.16% day(-1) at 24 degrees C. A survival tipping point was apparent between 21 and 24 degrees C, with net mortality of 6 and 10% at 17 and 21 degrees C, respectively, increasing to 100% at 24 degrees C. Sacrificial gill and haemolymph samples taken every 4-8 weeks showed little evidence of temperature perturbation upon either haemocyte function or the metabolomic profile during the first 4-6 months of incubation. Beyond 6 months, the proportion of haemocytes showing signs of respiratory burst (superoxide-positive) or apoptosis increased steadily at 24 degrees C, along with a substantial increase in the levels of amino acids frequently associated with anaerobiosis or anti-oxidant support. During this period, even the more benign temperature treatments of 17 and 21 degrees C showed increased haemocyte apoptosis and a metabolite profile consistent with increasing protein catabolism. Prolonged exposure to artificially stabilised 'summer' temperatures therefore appears detrimental to P. canaliculus, with important implications for the operation of captive broodstock conditioning systems. While stable, elevated temperatures up to 24 degrees C are unlikely to fully account for current observations of summer mortality, disruptions to energy metabolism and immunocompetency are likely to increase the mussels' vulnerability to pathogens and other stressors. On-going research is required to assess the impacts of realistic, fluctuating temperatures, with consideration of the implications for potential pathogens.

AB  - In southern India's State of Kerala during August 2018, a prolonged period of extreme rainfall resulted in devastating floods and landslides. In order to understand its influence on the modelling of this severe rainfall event, sea surface temperature (SST) from measurements and forecasts is updated at the lower boundary of a mesoscale model in this work. The one-way nested domains of the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model are used in this work. Optimum interpolation sea surface temperature (OISST) from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and coupled forecast system sea surface temperature (CFSSST) from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) are used to update SST during model integration. The control experiment, however, made use of skin temperature data from the final analysis (FNL) of the NCEP. When compared to observations, control simulations overpredict the patterns of rainfall. When OISST and CFSSST are used, the rainfall distribution could well be simulated fairly accurately. The overprediction shown in the control simulation may have been reduced as a result of the latent heat flux values being lower and closer to observation when OISST and CFSSST are used. When OISST and CFSSST are updated, the 850 hPa circulation fields are significantly improved. The work emphasizes the role of employing reliable time-varying lower boundary conditions, which can significantly affect the simulation of extreme precipitation events using a mesoscale model. The role of SST, as realized through the better representation of latent heat flux, might have resulted in the better simulation of heavy rainfall using WRF when forced with observed and forecasted SST.

AB  - Heat stress is a major challenge in dairy cattle farming and leads to economic losses. This study aims to determine the impact of heat stress on dairy cattle under a hot and humid climate. Milk yield test records between 2015 to 2019 were collected from 532 first lactating Friesian crossbred cows. Hourly values of temperature (dry bulb), relative humidity, surface wind speed, and solar radiation over 24 h collected from the national weather station in Malaysia were averaged and computed into four temperature indexes (TI). The heat stress threshold was identified using a two-slope broken line regression and the magnitude of milk loss was determined by the degree of decline fitted to a Legendre polynomial regression. Environmental parameters and TI values were observed to be influenced by the dry and monsoon season. Thresholds reported ranged between 73 (TI4) to 79 (TI3) according to the respective TI measured. The index values were higher than the reported studies in temperate, semi-arid and mediterranean climates. The largest milk decline was determined as 0.181 kg in mild, 0.267 kg in moderate, and 0.523 kg in extreme heat stress conditions, respectively, when using the conventional TI1. Thresholds determined in the current study can be used for annual forecasting and targeted heat stress mitigation efforts.

AB  - The study focuses on understanding the future exposure to rainfall and temperature extremes in one of the world's most populous islands, Java, Indonesia. We use the high-resolution climate projections from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) simulation for Southeast Asia by 2100 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Results show that the island will likely experience drying in the lowlands due to annual rainfall decline by approximately 13%-18%, potentially exposing around 27%-73% of the population (varying under different scenarios) during the end of the century (2060-2099). Additionally, the future drying condition may be exacerbated by extreme temperatures with a 1.7-3.1 degrees C increase in maximum daily temperature, linked with more than half of the population (63%) likely to experience at least an unprecedented temperature of 3 degrees C under RCP8.5. Our seasonal analysis also suggests that dry seasons get even drier, and wet seasons get wetter. In terms of landuse areas exposed, we show a higher fraction of crop and forest areas may face both drying and warming, which can potentially lead to crop failure and wildfire. Our study indicates that compound drought and heat may be a common threat in lowland Java in the future, while intensifying rainfall extremes in the uplands may lead to flash flooding downstream and landslides. These findings highlight the urgent need for adaptation and mitigation strategies to reduce the risks associated with climate change in Java as one of Indonesia's most critical regions in the future.

AB  - Global warming causes a temperature rise and alteration of other meteorological variables that directly or indirectly affect human comfort. The wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) incorporates the effects of multiple meteorological variables to provide a reliable measure of human thermal stress. Despite the large significance of WBGT on public health, studies related to characterization and trends assessment of WBGT are limited in the tropical humid region like Peninsular Malaysia due to the unavailability of all meteorological variables required for such analysis. This study employed reanalysis meteorological data of ERA5 to assess the characteristics and changes in hourly, daily, monthly, seasonal and annual outdoor WBGT over peninsular Malaysia for the period 1959-2021 using the Liljegren method. The WBGT values were classified into five categories to assess the human thermal stress levels defined by the United States Department of the Army (USDA). The mean daily WBGT in PM varies from 21.5 degrees C in the central south elevated region to 30.5 degrees C in the western coastal region. It always reaches a heat-related illness risk level (31.20 degrees C) in the afternoon during monsoon and extreme stress conditions during inter-monsoonal periods. The trend analysis revealed an increase in WBGT for all the time scales. The higher increase in the mean and maximum WBGT was estimated in the coastal and south regions, nearly by 0.10 to 0.25 degrees C/decade. The increase in mean nighttime WBGT was 0.24 degrees C/decade, while in mean daytime WBGT was 0.11 degrees C/decade. The increase in WBGT caused a gradual expansion of areas experiencing daily WBGT exceeding a high-risk level for 5 h (11 AM to 3 PM). The information and maps generated in this study can be used for mitigation planning of heat-related stress risk in PM, where temperature extremes have grown rapidly in recent years.

AB  - The increasing temperatures and shifts in meteorological conditions have heightened the vulnerability of Bangladesh's densely populated regions, known for their high heat and humidity, to potential health hazards. While the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) is a widely acknowledged and robust measure for evaluating heat stress in various occupational and outdoor environments, its widespread application is impeded by the complexity of calculations, the substantial computational resources required, and the need for specialized expertise, particularly in developing nations. Therefore, this study aimed to develop simplified equations for estimating WBGT in Bangladesh using meteorological variables. This study applied Liljegren's model on high-resolution reanalysis data of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ERA5) to calculate WBGT from 1979 to 2021. Subsequently, linear and nonlinear regressions were used to derive simplified equations for estimating Liljegren WBGT in Bangladesh. The quadratic regression models offer simplified equations for WBGT estimation. The model with only temperature (Ta) as an input estimates WBGT with an R2 of 0.967 and an RMSE of 0.716, effectively capturing a significant portion of WBGT variability. The inclusion of solar radiation (SR) with Ta improved the performance, with an R2 of 0.996 and an RMSE of 0.242. The best parsimonious model, with an R2 of 0.986 and an RMSE of 0.471, is derived when wind speed is considered with Ta and SR inputs, achieving an R2 of 0.993 and an RMSE of 0.331. Comprehensive graphical and statistical analyses confirm the high accuracy of all models. The three-input model notably demonstrates exceptional performance, attaining optimal values for critical metrics, including extreme WBGT. The results affirm the practical suitability of the derived models for accurate estimations of WBGT in Bangladesh. These equations provide simplified tools for assessing heat stress conditions, contributing to public health initiatives, occupational safety guidelines, and climate change adaptation strategies.
   This study in Bangladesh employed Liljegren's model and quadratic regression techniques to develop simplified equations for precise estimation of Wet Bulb Globe Temperature. These equations, incorporating temperature, solar radiation, and wind speed data, serve as vital tools for evaluating heat stress, and informing public health strategies, and climate adaptation efforts. image

AB  - Ultra-conductive heat transport showcases significant potentials in popular thermal managements with convection, phase change, and heat source. However, it is captivated impossible for passive thermal manipulation, usually bounded by intrinsic thermal conductivities of natural materials, to outperform these active recipes in need of extra energy payload. Here, a robust recipe to create passive ultra-conductive thermal metamaterials consisting of nothing but bulk natural materials is reported. Thanks to the local thermal resistance regulation by vertical thermal transport channel, the proof-of-concept thermal metamaterials experimentally demonstrate extreme effective conductivity (1915 W m(-1) K-1) solely with naturally occurring materials. The purely conductive modulation without any external energy is comparable to active counterparts, and further reveals its robustness and unexpected convenience. The findings construct a high-efficient paradigm of passive thermal management with ultra-conductive heat transport, and further hint potentials in other Laplace fields, e.g., DC and magnetostatics.

AB  - The presence of unavoidable extreme thermal fields, as well as frequent incidents of Lithium-ion battery (LIB) fires, emphasizes the importance of understanding the contribution of external heat energy to the degradation and failure of the LIB. In this study, we quantified the heat energy from the external heat source, heat transferred, and heat causing the safety vent crack to better understand the relationship between external thermal stress and LIB behavior during external heating tests. For experior data purposes, a series of external heating testing was performed with the NCA and LCO LIBs with 25-100% SOC. The external heat energy (qh) required to crack the safety vent varied between 92.70 and 232.80 kJ/m3 and 142.62-172.14 kJ/m(3) for NCA and LCO, respectively. During venting at 25-100% SOC, the heat transferred for NCA and LCO were 56.77-136.07 kJ/m3 and 86.56-102.81 kJ/m(3), respectively, representing 58.45-78.46% and 57.00-61.63% of the qh. Around 117.71-224.76 kJ/m3 and 181.10-218.59 kJ/m3 were produced by side reactions in NCA and LCO before the safety vent crack. The LIB's internal heat energy for breaking the safety disc (qsv) was estimated to be 174.49-360.83 kJ/m3 in NCA and 269.00-321.40 kJ/m3 in LCO. The qrec to qh ratio indicates that less qh may be required for the higher SOC LIB to enter stage II while the produced qgen reaches a maximum of 2 and 1.5 times that of qh for 100% NCA and LCO, respectively. During the breakout of the disc, the qsv exceeds the qh to about 2.4 and 1.9 times for 100% NCA and LCO, respectively. The findings of this study provide fundamentals on the thermal behavior of LIBs which can be used to understand the difference in hazard in transporting different types of LIBs, and decide how to implement designs for resisting thermal runaway propagation.

AB  - Due to the severe effect of urban heat island (UHI), the street geometries, including the orientation and aspect ratio, exert certain impacts on urban microclimates and outdoor thermal comfort. Designing sustainable cities requires a holistic approach. The objective of this study is to investigate how the canyon aspect ratio and orientation affect the street microclimate and outdoor thermal comfort in central business districts under the local climate of Nanjing city. To achieve this goal, a series of numerical simulations were conducted based on a total of 64 urban scenarios with various canyon aspect ratios and orientations. The microclimate simulation results for different urban models were used to predict the outdoor thermal comfort, which was evaluated with the physiological equivalent temperature (PET) index. The PET results indicate a certain correlation between canyon geometries and outdoor thermal comfort. Finally, several suggestions were proposed for urban planners and designers to implement mitigation strategies and methods to alleviate extreme heat stress, and toward the sustainable development of the contemporary cities.

AB  - Understanding thermal transport across metal/semiconductor interfaces is crucial for the heat dissipation of electronics. The dominant heat carriers in non-metals, phonons, are thought to transport elastically across most interfaces, except for a few extreme cases where the two materials that formed the interface are highly dissimilar with a large difference in Debye temperature. In this work, we show that even for two materials with similar Debye temperatures (Al/Si, Al/GaN), a substantial portion of phonons will transport inelastically across their interfaces at high temperatures, significantly enhancing interface thermal conductance. Moreover, we find that interface sharpness strongly affects phonon transport process. For atomically sharp interfaces, phonons are allowed to transport inelastically and interface thermal conductance linearly increases at high temperatures. With a diffuse interface, inelastic phonon transport diminishes. Our results provide new insights on phonon transport across interfaces and open up opportunities for engineering interface thermal conductance specifically for materials of relevance to microelectronics.
   Phonons are thought to transport elastically across most interfaces. Here, the authors show that a substantial portion of phonons transport inelastically, adding another heat conduction channel and enhancing thermal conductance across interfaces.

AB  - Exposure to extreme temperature during pregnancy was associated with abnormal birth outcomes including preterm birth, low birth weight, and placental abortion. Bee bread is a natural product created by bees that is highly nutritional and was recommended for human consumption as a source of high energy and protein. Hence, this study aims to determine the effect of bee bread on pregnancy outcomes and the reproductive organs (i.e. ovary and uterus) of the Sprague Dawley rats exposed to heat stress. Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were divided into four treatment groups (Control (C: standard feeding); Treatment 1 (T1: Bee bread); Treatment 2 (T2: Heat stress) and Treatment 3 (T3: Bee bread + Heat stress)). Rats from T1 and T3 groups received bee bread (0.5 g/kg body weight/day) orally using oral gavage starting from day-0 of pregnancy until delivery, while rats from T2 and T3 groups were exposed to 43 degrees C of heat by using an egg incubator for 45 min/day until delivery. After delivery, pregnancy outcomes were assessed and the dams were euthanised. Reproductive organs were dissected and weighed. Rats in the T2 group had significantly (p<0.05) decreased litter size and foetal birth weight as well as an increased percentage of resorption and increased gestation period when compared with C and T1 groups. T3 group had shown improvement as positive effects of bee bread during heat stress exposure on litter size, foetal birth weight and percentage of resorption. It can be concluded that bee bread supplementation has beneficial effects on the adverse effects of pregnancy in rats subject to heat stress.

AB  - Urban overheating, driven by global climate change and urban development, is a major contemporary challenge that substantially impacts urban livability and sustainability. Overheating represents a multifaceted threat to the well-being, performance, and health of individuals as well as the energy efficiency and economy of cities, and it is influenced by complex interactions between building, city, and global scale climates. In recent decades, extensive discipline-specific research has characterized urban heat and assessed its implications on human life, including ongoing efforts to bridge neighboring disciplines. The research horizon now encompasses complex problems involving a wide range of disciplines, and therefore comprehensive and integrated assessments are needed that address such interdisciplinarity. Here, our objective is to go beyond a review of existing literature and instead provide a broad overview and integrated assessments of urban overheating, defining holistic pathways for addressing the impacts on human life. We (a) detail the characterization of heat hazards and exposure across different scales and in various disciplines, (b) identify individual sensitivities to urban overheating that increase vulnerability and cause adverse impacts in different populations, (c) elaborate on adaptive capacities that individuals and cities can adopt, (d) document the impacts of urban overheating on health and energy, and (e) discuss frontiers of theoretical and applied urban climatology, built environment design, and governance toward reduction of heat exposure and vulnerability at various scales. The most critical challenges in future research and application are identified, targeting both the gaps and the need for greater integration in overheating assessments.

AB  - The rise of Urban Heat Island (UHI) is harming people across megacities in the world. In Jakarta, the informal settlements are most affected due to the lack of adequate infrastructure to deal with the heat. The heat problem in the informal settlements was primarily exacerbated by overcrowding and a lack of access to cooling infrastructures. In this paper, we observe how residents of the informal settlements take on a cooling practice collectively. Our study is situated in five urban kampongs located in the most populated sub-districts (kelurahan) in Jakarta. Nine months of ethnographic fieldwork were conducted to unpack the residents' endeavor to mitigate the heat problem. To explicate the process and the role of these cooling facilities, we use the notion of social practice comprising three fundamental elements: competence, material, and meaning. "Social practice" aptly characterizes how the residents in each kampong worked together to build cooling places that also function as communal spaces. Our research discovered that despite limited resources and technical competence, each kampong recognized the necessity of communal spaces to maintain their cooling practices. These measures enabled them to engage in cooling practices while building social relationships through chilling outdoors. By demonstrating the capacity of residents in the informal settlements for constructing vernacular forms of cooling infrastructure, this paper offers a pluralistic view of heat mitigation in megacities of the Global South.

AB  - By dividing the supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle and the transcritical CO2 refrigeration cycle in the cogeneration system, this paper constructs their energy flow models, respectively. Introducing thermal resistance and thermomotive force into the energy flow model, the relationship between system performance, operating parameters, and structural parameters are established. At the same time, the topological structure and component characteristics of the system are also revealed. Then, through the study of the established energy flow model, the air and CO2 heat capacity flow ratio is changed, respectively ss. And the seawater parameters at the inlet of the condenser to study the refrigerating power of the transcritical CO2 refrigeration cycle. It is found that when the air CO2 heat capacity flow ratio ss=8, the refrigerating power of the system reaches the extreme value. Higher water flow and lower inlet water temperature can improve the refrigerating ability of the system. In addition, in the supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle, it is studied that changing the exhaust gas inlet parameters can affect the heat transfer of the heat exchanger on the power cycle side. The results show that higher temperature flue gas and higher flue gas flow can improve the heat transfer of the heat exchanger. Through the research of this paper, it found that the establishment of an energy flow model can indeed solve the problems of performance analysis and optimization design of different systems more conveniently and accurately.

AB  - A reliable prediction of sustainable energy consumption is key for designing environmentally friendly buildings. In this study, three novel hybrid intelligent methods, namely the grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA), wind-driven optimization (WDO), and biogeography-based optimization (BBO), are employed to optimize the multitarget prediction of heating loads (HLs) and cooling loads (CLs) in the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Concerning the optimization of the applied algorithms, a series of swarm-based iterations are performed, and the best structure is proposed for each model. The GOA, WDO, and BBO algorithms are mixed with a class of feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs), which is called a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to predict the HL and CL. According to the sensitivity analysis, the WDO with swarm size = 500 proposes the most-fitted ANN. The proposed WDO-ANN provided an accurate prediction in terms of heating load (training (R-2 correlation = 0.977 and RMSE error = 0.183) and testing (R-2 correlation = 0.973 and RMSE error = 0.190)) and yielded the best-fitted prediction in terms of cooling load (training (R-2 correlation = 0.99 and RMSE error = 0.147) and testing (R-2 correlation = 0.99 and RMSE error = 0.148)).

AB  - Low-probability but high-impact extreme events, such as floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, etc., could threaten the security of a multi-energy system, especially on the distribution level, and cause severe energy supply outages. In this paper, a coordinated restoration method is presented for the renewable energy-integrated multi-energy distribution system (MDS) with several coupling points to coordinate the preparation and load recovery stages after the extreme event. First, the MDS restoration is comprehensively modeled with coupled power and thermal network constraints. Especially, the thermal inertia, which is in the form of pipe storage and thermal demand response of smart buildings to serve as a buffer when the source fails, is fully utilized to reduce the energy supply cost after disasters. Secondly, both preparation and load recovery stage measures are employed to facilitate efficient and reliable system restoration. Furthermore, multiple uncertainties from the renewable generation and power demands in the MDS restoration are dealt with via a risk-averse two-stage stochastic programming approach. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of our method and its superiority over the traditional restoration methods.

AB  - The structure, layers, and mix of a particular type of textile material affects how warm and permeable to moisture a piece of clothing is. The microclimate region between the human body and clothes also has an impact on it. Designing warm clothing and choosing materials can be guided by the inverse problem of the heat and moisture transfer model and its parameter determination in winter clothing. This paper investigates the mathematical modeling of heat and moisture transfer of a class of textile materials based on PSO (abbreviation: PSO). Under the two categories of temperature and humidity combinations mentioned above, the three materials exhibit extreme values and are one of a kind. The disturbance function of polypropylene fiber material at 5% is 10, the disturbance function of polyester material at 5% is 8, and the disturbance function of wool material at 5% is 18 when the fabric thickness reaches 0.012. PSO was used in this experiment to calculate the thickness inversion results for fabrics made of polypropylene, polyester, nd wool. The results are consistent with those IP: 203.8.109.20 On: Wed, 10 May 2023 06:27:58 in the figure. In order to solve the inverse problem of functional design,it is necessary to mathematically study Copyright: American Scientific Publishers the transfer of heat and moisture through textile materials.

AB  - An inability of the body to appropriately respond to extreme temperatures will result in pathological changes to vital organs and adverse hematological changes. Mild heat exposure of a bird to a temperature above the zone of thermoneutrality can induce subclinical heat stress, which may be a precursor to illness. The ability to identify subtle changes that may be associated with subclinical heat stress can be important in early diagnosis and treatment of heat stress in birds. Pathological changes to internal body organs, post-heat exposure, were microscopically examined in 13 budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus), 15 zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), and 8 diamond doves (Geopelia cuneata) as model species for the bird orders Psittaciformes, Passeriformes, and Columbiformes, respectively. There was mild to moderate congestion of the lungs of 28/36 birds examined, including all of the budgerigars and diamond doves. In 8/15 zebra finches no significant lung congestion was noted. Interstitial and pulmonary hemorrhage was in observed in one diamond dove. The most common hepatic pathologic change identified was micro- and macro-vesicular hepatocellular vacuolation (4/15 zebra finches, 5/13 budgerigars, and 8/8 diamond doves). There was mild to moderate congestion in the kidneys of 1/15 zebra finch, 2/13 budgerigars, and 4/8 diamond doves, as well as in the gastrointestinal tract of 1/15 zebra finch and 7/8 budgerigars. Budgerigars showed a decrease in hematocrit and a significant change in the numbers of heterophils and lymphocytes following heat exposure. The basophil population of cells remained relatively stable in both budgerigars and diamond doves. These findings indicate avian species differences in body organ and hematological changes following exposure to similar elevations in environmental temperatures.

AB  - Based on the experimental results, this study develops a multi-objective optimization scheme to obtain the set of optimal process parameters for pulsed laser direct cutting of non-oriented silicon steel sheets for manufacturing motor core laminations. The experiments were conducted in the nital solvent, which was the one with the smallest thermal effect of laser cutting among the candidate environments of air, deionized water, alcohol, lubricant oil, sodium chloride solution, and nital solution. The laser was a pulsed Nd:YAG nanosecond laser and the thickness of the silicon steel was 100 mu m. The effects of three laser process parameters, laser power (P), cutting speed (v), and pulse repetition rate (f) on the cutting qualities of the heat-affected zone (HAZ), cutting time (TC), and multiple dimensional accuracies of the cut core lamination were examined. The inspected geometric accuracies included the errors in inner and outer core diameters (ED1 and ED2), the error in tooth width (EL), and the roundness of inner and outer diameters (C1 and C2). The developed multi-objective optimization model was a PSI-based ELM-GA scheme consisting of the extreme learning machine (ELM) model for connecting the inputs and the outputs, the preference selection index (PSI) method for obtaining the weighted multi-objective function, and the genetic algorithm (GA) for process optimization. Through employing the predicted optimal process parameter set, the validation experiment showed that the errors between the prediction and the experimental result for the seven qualities of HAZ, ED1, ED2, C1, C2, EL, and TC were 4.04%, 6.25%, 4.02%, 0.48%, 2.14%, 5.09%, and 1.25%, respectively. The HAZ and geometric accuracy of the cut core laminations were qualified for the subsequent lamination assembly. Consequently, the merit of direct formation of ready-for-assembly core laminations without the need for any post-processing renders the proposed laser cutting scheme an economical and effective approach for manufacturing motor core laminations from thin silicon steel sheets.

AB  - Exposure to extreme environmental heat or cold during military activities can impose severe thermal strain, leading to impairments in task performance and increasing the risk of exertional heat (including heat stroke) and cold injuries that can be life-threatening. Substantial individual variability in physiological tolerance to thermal stress necessitates an individualized approach to mitigate the deleterious effects of thermal stress, such as physiological monitoring of individual thermal strain. During heat exposure, measurements of deep-body (Tc) and skin temperatures and heart rate can provide some indication of thermal strain. Combining these physiological variables with biomechanical markers of gait (in)stability may provide further insight on central nervous system dysfunction - the key criterion of exertional heat stroke (EHS). Thermal strain in cold environments can be monitored with skin temperature (peripheral and proximal), shivering thermogenesis and Tc. Noninvasive methods for real-time estimation of Tc have been developed and some appear to be promising but require further validation. Decision-support tools provide useful information for planning activities and biomarkers can be used to improve their predictions, thus maximizing safety and performance during hot- and cold-weather operations. With better understanding on the etiology and pathophysiology of EHS, the microbiome and markers of the inflammatory responses have been identified as novel biomarkers of heat intolerance. This review aims to (i) discuss selected physiological and biomechanical markers of heat or cold strain, (ii) how biomarkers may be used to ensure operational readiness in hot and cold environments, and (iii) present novel molecular biomarkers (e.g., microbiome, inflammatory cytokines) for preventing EHS.

AB  - Increasing global surface temperatures is posing a major food security challenge. Part of the solution to address this problem is to improve crop heat resilience, especially during grain development, along with agronomic decisions such as shift in planting time and increasing crop diversification. Rice is a major food crop consumed by more than 3 billion people. For rice, thermal sensitivity of reproductive development and grain filling is well-documented, while knowledge concerning the impact of heat stress (HS) on early seed development is limited. Here, we aim to study the phenotypic variation in a set of diverse rice accessions for elucidating the HS response during early seed development. To explore the variation in HS sensitivity, we investigated aus (1), indica (2), temperate japonica (2), and tropical japonica (4) accessions for their HS (39/35 degrees C) response during early seed development that accounts for transition of endosperm from syncytial to cellularization, which broadly corresponds to 24 and 96 hr after fertilization (HAF), respectively, in rice. The two indica and one of the tropical japonica accessions exhibited severe heat sensitivity with increased seed abortion; three tropical japonicas and an aus accession showed moderate heat tolerance, while temperate japonicas exhibited strong heat tolerance. The accessions exhibiting extreme heat sensitivity maintain seed size at the expense of number of fully developed mature seeds, while the accessions showing relative resilience to the transient HS maintained number of fully developed seeds but compromised on seed size, especially seed length. Further, histochemical analysis revealed that all the tested accessions have delayed endosperm cellularization upon exposure to the transient HS by 96 HAF; however, the rate of cellularization was different among the accessions. These findings were further corroborated by upregulation of cellularization-associated marker genes in the developing seeds from the heat-stressed samples.

AB  - Energy performance of buildings is an important issue to estimate the energy waste of buildings and their impact on the environment, so designing energy-efficient buildings could improve their energy performance. In this case, the estimation of heating and cooling loads plays an important role in this regard. However, there are few factors with unpredictable influences on the heating and cooling loads. This study has attempted to analyze the eight parameters that can significantly affect the heating and cooling loads through the Neuro-fuzzy logic approach. Accordingly, the eight parameters of relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area and glazing area distribution were considered as inputs and predicting the cooling and heating load changes was regarded as the output of this study. The model was developed and its results were measured in two regression indicators of r and RMSE. Based on the obtained results it was found that roof has the strongest impact on heating and cooling loads (RMSE: 4.3596), moreover, if two factors were concurrently changed, then the combination of relative compactness and wall area can significantly affect the heating and cooling loads (RMSE: 2.6312). The most influential combination of three factors is observed as well for the heating and cooling load and these factors are relative compactness, wall area and glazing area (0.5948). The most influential combination of three factors is observed as well for the hearing load and these factors are relative compactness, wall area and glazing area (RMSE: 0.5948 and RMSE: 1.5769 for heating and cooling load, respectively). However, Neuro-fuzzy logic showed overfitting for more than two inputs, therefore it is not recommended for more than two inputs.

AB  - In Bangkok, reducing the extreme heat in summer is a critical challenge for urban planners and researchers associated with the built environment. A significant cause of such extreme heat is the rapid expansion of residential development without corresponding planning and design. This work explores layout designs for residential townhouses, building geometries, and tree-planting patterns for enhancing outdoor thermal comfort in a Bangkok suburb. The microclimatic conditions of a total of 192 designs were simulated through modeling based on ENVI-met software. The climatic conditions were then transferred to the ENVI-met BioMET package to calculate the hourly physiological equivalent temperature (PET) values in a street canyon. The information was used to determine acceptable comfort conditions, as compared to an upper limit of outdoor thermal comfort from a prior work. It is found that the aspect ratio and street canyon orientation can significantly improve outdoor thermal comfort performance, as compared to increases in building density or decreases in tree-planting distance. Tree and building shade can reduce the PET value by 8.6 degrees C and 14.2 degrees C, respectively. For example, street trees can increase the outdoor thermal comfort conditions of an avenue canyon (H/W = 0.5-0.7) by up to 82%. However, building and tree shade cannot reduce the extreme conditions in E-W oriented canyons, as the overhead shade requires further protection from the angle of the sun's rays. The study's findings could assist in the development of new guidelines for the design and planning of residential townhouse projects for providing a cooler outdoor environment and comfortable conditions, especially in hot-humid areas of Bangkok.

AB  - Next-generation rolls such as super-cermet rolls can be manufactured only by adopting a sleeve roll structure where the shaft is shrink-fitted into the sleeve. To prevent sleeve cracking due to sleeve slip, reducing the residual stress at the inner surface of the sleeve is important. In this paper, therefore, two extreme manufacturing processes are investigated to provide suitable residual stress to the sleeve; one is the process of quenching/tempering a solid roll and boring the inside to manufacture a sleeve. The other is the process in which the inside of a solid roll is lathed to manufacture a sleeve, which is then quenched/tempered. The results show that the latter sleeve heat treatment is better than the former solid heat treatment because the tensile residual stress can be reduced at the sleeve inside. After shrink-fitting of the shaft into the latter sleeve, the fatigue strength and the residual stress are discussed in comparison with the ones of the solid roll currently and widely used.

AB  - Water storage plays an important role in mitigating heat and flooding in urban areas. Assessment of the water storage capacity of cities remains challenging due to the inherent heterogeneity of the urban surface. Traditionally, effective storage has been estimated from runoff. Here, we present a novel approach to estimate effective water storage capacity from recession rates of observed evaporation during precipitation-free periods. We test this approach for cities at neighborhood scale with eddy-covariance based latent heat flux observations from 14 contrasting sites with different local climate zones, vegetation cover and characteristics, and climates. Based on analysis of 583 drydowns, we find storage capacities to vary between 1.3 and 28.4 mm, corresponding to e-folding timescales of 1.8-20.1 days. This makes the urban storage capacity at least five times smaller than all the observed values for natural ecosystems, reflecting an evaporation regime characterized by extreme water limitation.

AB  - Persistent-heavy-haze (PHH) events and extreme-cold temperatures are prevalent problems confronting the Northeastern part of China (especially Harbin) during the prolonged winter season, leading to two challenging phenomena known as the urban-heat/cold-island (UHI/UCI) and urban-pollution-island (UPI) intensities (UHII/ UCII and UPII) defined as the differences between urban and rural temperature/air pollution. Although UHI and UPI have been explored, the mechanisms and novel drivers (urban-stilling-island-intensity (USII), urban-drynessisland-intensity (UDII), and urban-planetary-boundary-layer-height-intensity (UPBLHI) which are by-products of wind speed (WS), relative humidity, and planetary-boundary-layer-height (PBLH), respectively; with wind direction (WD)) influencing them are still underexplored in extreme-cold regions. Using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem), we designed the mechanisms into non-radiativeeffect (NRE), direct-radiative-effect (DRE), indirect-radiative-effect (IRE), with slope-and-shading-effect (SSE) during early-winter-heavy-haze-episode (EWHHE; December 2019) and peak-winter-persistent-heavy-hazeepisode (PWPHHE; January 2020). We found that the spatial distributions of the mass concentration of pollutants (e.g., PM2.5) dominated the downtown, with the IRE and SSE accounting for >200 mu g/m(3) in both episodes. In assessing the drivers impacting UHII and UPII, the USII favors the increase of UHII and UPII in the EWHHE but lowers the UCII in PWPHHE. Moreover, the UDII and UPBLHI were weaker in PWPHHE than the EWHHE, with NO2 having the highest UDII at 7.05% (SSE), 7.00% (IRE and NRE), and 6.24% (DRE); hence, revealing that PHH lowered the PBLH. Additionally, the dominant south-to-north WD impacted the UHII and UPII. Generally, low USII, UDII, and UPBLHI with WD are major contributors to PHH in the cold region. Therefore, this work provides insight into drivers for other urban areas with severe air pollution and extreme cold problems.

AB  - Climate change causing an increase of frequency and magnitude of heat waves has a huge impact on the urban population worldwide. In Indonesia, the Southeast Asian country in the tropical climate zone, the increasing heat wave duration due to climate change will be also magnified by projected rapid urbanization. Therefore, not only climate change mitigation measures but also adaptation solutions to more frequent extreme weather events are necessary. Adaptation is essential at local levels. The projected increase of the heat wave duration will trigger greater health-related risks. It will also drive higher energy demands, particularly in urban areas, for cooling. New smart solutions for growing urbanization for reducing urban heat island phenomenon are critical, but in order to identify them, analyzing the changing magnitude and spatial distribution of urban heat is essential. We projected the current and future spatial variability of heat stress index in three cities in Indonesia, namely, Medan, Surabaya, and Denpasar, under climate change and land-cover change scenarios, and quantified it with the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) for two periods, baseline (1981-2005) and future (2018-2042). Our results demonstrated that currently the higher level of the UTCI was identified in the urban centers of all three cities, indicating the contribution of urban heat island phenomenon to the higher UTCI. Under climate change scenarios, all three cities will experience increase of the heat, whereas applying the land-cover scenario demonstrated that in only Medan and Denpasar, the UTCI is likely to experience a higher increase by 3.1 degrees C; however, in Surabaya, the UTCI will experience 0.84 degrees C decrease in the period 2018-2042 due to urban greening. This study advanced the UTCI methodology by demonstrating its applicability for urban heat warning systems and for monitoring of the urban green cooling effect, as well as it provides a base for adaptation measures' planning.

AB  - Using spatially disaggregated daily crime data for the City of Los Angeles, this paper estimates the impact of ambient temperature on crime, and how this relationship varies across neighborhoods. Our estimates suggest that, relative to cooler days, overall crime rates are 1.72% and 1.90% higher when daily maximum temperature exceeds 75 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit respectively. This heat-crime relationship is much stronger in low-income neighborhoods, and is largely driven by non-pecuniary crimes of passion, such as domestic crimes and crimes against intimate partners. Using internal policing data, we find that the surge in crime is not a result of reduced policing effort in low-income areas during hot days. Instead, we document that characteristics of the built environment such as housing age and urban greenery are highly correlated with the slope of the heat-crime relationship. Our estimates suggest that the mon-etary cost of heat-induced crime incurred by the highest poverty neighborhoods is five times larger than that incurred by more affluent areas, highlighting the starkly differential impact of extreme weather even over small geographies within cities.

AB  - Due to the extreme use of fossil fuels and increasing environmental problems, the steel industries have been always seeking solutions to decrease energy consumption. These efforts will not only reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) but also decrease the costs of these industries. In this study, we investigated the effects of burners' heating load distribution in a hot-rolling preheating furnace, by numerical modeling. This study incorporates a three-dimensional model for preheating furnaces with a given geometry and various heating loads' distribution. Following the determination of boundary conditions, the simulation process will be carried out. This research will be evaluated in four different cases. In one case, the burners' load distribution is uniform and in the other three cases the burners' load distribution decreases exponentially along with the furnace. The results of this study indicate that the best scenario from a performance perspective is true, the exponential expression X(-0.8)in which the energy consumption decreases up to 44 %, and the slab temperature will be reached to the given desired temperature in the furnace.

AB  - 1. Many studies have quantified the ecological impacts of individual foundation species (FS). However, emerging data suggest that FS often co--occur, potentially inhibiting or facilitating one another, thereby causing indirect, cascading effects on surrounding communities. Furthermore, global warming is accelerating, but little is known about how interactions between co-occurring FS vary with temperature.
   2. Shallow aquatic sedimentary systems are often dominated by three types of FS: slower-growing clonal angiosperms, faster-growing solitary seaweeds and shell-forming filter-and deposit-feeding bivalves. Here, we tested the impacts of one FS on another by analyzing manipulative interaction experiments from 148 papers with a global meta-analysis.
   3. We calculated 1942 (non-independent) Hedges' g effect sizes, f rom 11,652 extracted values over performance responses, such as abundances, growth or survival of FS and their associated standard deviations and replication levels. Standard aggregation procedures generated 511 independent Hedges' g that were classified into six types of reciprocal impacts between FS.
   4. We found that (i) seaweeds had consistent negative impacts on angiosperms across performance responses, organismal sizes, experimental approaches and ecosystem types; (ii) angiosperms and bivalves generally had positive impacts on each other (e.g. positive effects of angiosperms on bivalves were consistent across organismal sizes and experimental approaches, but angiosperm effect on bivalve growth and bivalve effect on angiosperm abundance were not significant); (iii) bivalves positively affected seaweeds (particularly on growth responses); (iv) there were generally no net effects of seaweeds on bivalves (except for the positive effect on growth) or angiosperms on seaweeds (except for the positive effect on 'other processes') and (v) bivalve interactions with other FS were typically more positive at higher temperatures, but angiosperm-seaweed interactions were not moderated by temperature.
   5. Synthesis. Despite variations in experimental and spatiotemporal conditions, the stronger positive interactions at higher temperatures suggest that facilitation, particularly involving bivalves, may become more important in a future warmer world. Importantly, addressing research gaps, such as the scarcity of FS interaction experiments from tropical and freshwater systems and for less studied species, as well as testing for density-dependent effects, could better inform aquatic ecosystem conservation and restoration efforts and broaden our knowledge of FS interactions in the Anthropocene.

AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for liveable, sustainable cities and decent jobs. The lack of attention to outdoor space design has a significant impact on the livability of the urban outdoor environment. As tropical areas have experienced a one-degree Celsius increase in the last four decades, working outdoors can become unbearably distressing due to thermal discomfort. This study links SDGs 11 and 8 by focusing on thermal comfort and heat exposure among outdoor informal workers -the street vendors working in outdoor markets. The cohorts in our study are vulnerable to extreme heat due to their working conditions, and the informality of their work presents additional susceptibility to severe heat exposure due to the lack of physical and social protection. We conducted a cross-sectional survey to measure microclimatic perceptions, such as Thermal Sensation Vote (TSV) and preference, Humidity Sensation Vote (HSV) and preference, Wind Sensation Vote (WSV) and preference, Sun Sensation Vote (SSV), and preference, as well as overall comfort vote (OCV). The results are useful in providing a preliminary illustration of Jakarta's microclimatic perceptions and thermal comfort from the perspective of vulnerable populations. We then discuss the impacts of thermal comfort on the city's liveability.

AB  - Deaths caused by extreme cold occur frequently, emergency heating needs to be greatly enhanced. In present work, a porous media catalytic combustion emergency heater was designed with a self-developed 1% Pt/ Al2O3 center dot SiO2 catalyst. Some evaluation indicators of the natural diffusion heater (including thermal efficiency, combustion efficiency, ignition temperature, cold start performance, combustion plate temperature uniformity, and infrared wavelength distribution) were established experimentally. According to the results, the catalyst possesses high activity (T-50 = 397.2 degrees C and T-90 = 463.2 degrees C) and nanoscale loading uniformity. Controlling the gas flow rate at 1 L/min can achieve the 21.56% thermal efficiency and 99.90% combustion efficiency. The heater can be preheated successfully at 120 degrees C and its cold start limitation is-30 degrees C. The infrared energy peak wavelength range (3-10 mu m) is matched to the absorption ranges of the human skin and common textiles. Be-sides, real-person heating was tested in the apparent temperature (AT) region of -14.8-12.4 degrees C. Subjects' skin temperatures, subjective thermal sensations, and optimization suggestions were collected, and the relationship between mean skin temperature and AT was modeled, which revealed the efficient heating capacity. Therefore, this paper opens up great prospects for practical emergency heating and evaluation method for alleviating the cold-stricken heating problems.

AB  - Although there is no doubt about the harmful effects of extreme weather and climate events, there is no consensus on the magnitude of these effects on health and disease infection. This study aims to evaluate the effect of temperature and precipitation on the health of individuals in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam using district fixed-effects regression. It finds that exposure to high temperature not only causes sickness and fever but also increases the risk of getting diarrhoea - an infectious disease. High precipitation also increases the probability of getting diseases. However, the effect of precipitation is remarkably lower than that of temperature. The effects of temperature and precipitation differ for different population groups. In Laos and Vietnam, urban and highly educated individuals are less likely to be affected by temperature and precipitation than rural and less educated ones.

AB  - In the present work, an attempt was made to experimentally quantify the boiling heat transfer coefficient (BHTC) of graphene oxide-water nano-suspension (NS) inflow boiling heat transfer regime. The NS was prepared at weight fractions of 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1% using the two-step method and further stabilized for 17 days (at wt% = 0.1). Results showed that the presence of graphene oxide nanoplatelets (GNPs) imposed an extreme fouling thermal resistance (FTR) to the surface, which caused a reduction in the BHTC over 1000 min of continuous operation after the CHF point. This was mainly due to the presence of the graphene oxide on the surface, which created a surficial fouling layer and heat accumulation on the surface. Instead, the sedimentation layer promoted the critical heat flux (CHF) point such that the point for water was 1370 kW/m(2) reaching 1640 kW/m(2) for NS at wt% = 0.1. Likewise, the highest BHTC of 17.4 kW/(m(2)K) at Re = 10,950 was obtained. Also, with increasing the heat flux and flow rate, the BHTC increased. The same trend was also identified with a mass fraction of GNPs up to CHF point. The increase in the BHTC was attributed to the intensification of the Brownian motion and thermophoresis effect in the boiling micro-layer close to the surface. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The impact of climate extremes, such as heat waves and extreme rainfall, can cause harvest failures, flooding, and droughts that ultimately threaten global food security, harming the region's economy. Fluctuations in streamflow indicate the sensitivity of streamflow responding to extreme precipitation events and other climatic variables (temperature extremes) that play a significant role in its generation. Pakistan is also considered one of the climate change hotspot regions in the world. The devastating impacts have often occurred in recent decades due to an excess or shortage of streamflow, majorly generated from the Upper Indus Basin (UIB). To better understand climate extremes' impact on streamflow, this study examined climate extremes and streamflow (Q) changes for three decades: 1990-1999, 2000-2009, and 2010-2019. Observed streamflow and meteorological data from nine sub-catchments across all climatic zones of the UIB were analyzed using RGui (R language coding program) and partial least squares regression (PLSR). Climatic variables were estimated, including precipitation extremes, temperature extremes, and potential evapotranspiration. The Mann-Kendal test was applied to the climatic indices, revealing that precipitation increased during the last 30 years, while maximum and minimum temperatures during the summer months decreased in the Karakoram region from 1990 to 2019. The spatiotemporal trend of consecutive dry days (CDD) indicated a more increasing tendency from 1990 to 2019, compared to the consecutive wet days (CWD), which showed a decreasing trend. PLSR was applied to assess the relation between climatic variables (extreme P, T indices, and evapotranspiration). It was found that the dominant climatic variables controlling annual streamflow include the r95p (very wet days) and R25mm (heavy precipitation days), maximum precipitation event amount, CWD, PRCPTOT (annual total precipitation), and RX5 (maximum five-day precipitation). The TXn (Min Tmax) and Tmax mean (average maximum temperature) dominate streamflow variables. Moreover, the impact of evapotranspiration (ET) on variations in streamflow is more pronounced in arid catchments. Precipitation is the predominant factor influencing streamflow generation in the UIB, followed by temperature. From streamflow quantification, it was found that climate-driven annual streamflow decreased during 1999-2019 in comparison to 1990-1999, with an increase in a few catchments like Kalam, which increased by about 3.94% from 2000 to 2010 and 10.30% from 2010 to 2019, and Shigar, which increased by 0.48% from 2000 to 2009 and 37.37% from 2010 to 2019 concerning 1990-1999. These variations were due to changes in these climatic parameters. The PLSR approach enables the identification of linkages between climatic variables and streamflow variability and the prediction of climate-driven floods. This study contributes to an enhanced identification and hydroclimatological trends and projections.

AB  - Among the many threats to food security, extremes of temperature, and unpredictable changes in temperature such as unseasonal frost or snowfall resulting from climate change have significant impacts on crop productivity and yields. It has been projected that for each increase by 1 degrees C of the global temperature, agricultural outputs of some staple food crops will decline by up to 3-8%. Alarmingly, reports from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have revealed that our earth experienced one of the warmest summers in 2022, indicating that temperature stress is not a threat that can be taken lightly. Global food prices have risen by more than 70% since the middle of 2020, however, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) projects that by 2027, the combined effects of climate change, conflict and poverty may lead to an additional rise in food prices by 8.5%. Taken together, the impacts of extreme temperatures on staple food supply amplify the risks of child malnutrition and food insecurity, especially in less-developed countries. This review offers a novel perspective on the intricate interplay between plant responses to heat and cold stresses, aiming to pave the way for innovative and efficient crop improvement programs crucial for ensuring a resilient and sustainable food supply in the face of climate change. A thorough and comprehensive understanding on plant mechanisms can effectively help agricultural industry to produce stress-resilient and climate-tolerant crops. Also, with the assistance from robust breeding techniques and genetic tools, the goal to achieve sustainable food supply chain can be attained.

AB  - Key message This study demonstrated that pyramiding of early morning flowering and heat tolerance QTLs (qEMF3 and qHTSF4.1) in rice is an efficient approach to maintain high spikelet fertility under high-temperature stress at flowering stage. High temperature at flowering stage of rice causes low spikelet fertility and low yield. To cope with high-temperature stress brought by climate change, two strategies were proposed to develop heat-resilient rice varieties. One is to escape the high temperature by flowering early in the morning, another is to enhance tolerance to high-temperature stress per se. Two promising QTLs for early morning flowering (qEMF3) and heat tolerance (qHTSF4.1) were introgressed into IR64 background, and Near isogenic lines (NILs) IR64 + qEMF3 (IR64EMF3) and IR64 + qHTSF4.1 (IR64HT4) were developed in previous studies. In this study, a QTL pyramiding line IR64 + qHTSF4.1 + qEMF3 (IR64HT4EMF3) was developed by marker-assisted selection of the progenies of previous NILs. The NILs were subjected to different high-temperature regimes in the indoor growth chambers and different locations in the field. In the indoor growth chambers, when high temperature starts early (before 11:00 am), IR64HT4 and IR64HT4EMF3 had higher spikelet fertility than IR64EMF3; when high temperature comes later (after 11:00 am), IR64EMF3 and IR64HT4EMF3 had higher spikelet fertility than IR64HT4. The flowering pattern of the IR64HT4EMF3 was earlier than IR64HT4, but similar to IR64EMF3 in the glasshouse, field and indoor growth chambers. IR64HT4EMF3 showed higher spikelet fertility than IR64EMF3 and IR64HT4 in the field in the Philippines. Thus, combination of early morning flowering and heat tolerance QTLs is an elegant breeding strategy to cope with future extreme climate.

AB  - In this work, Dy-promoted Ni/SiC-SiO2 catalysts with varied Dy loadings (0-1 %) were developed using the wet impregnation method and evaluated for their effectiveness in CO2 methanation. The characterization results reveal that Dy addition can reduce the Ni crystallite size, enhance the dispersion of active phase and increase the catalyst's reducibility. Among the prepared catalysts, the 0.5 %Dy-10 %Ni/SiC-SiO2 demonstrated the highest CH4 selectivity (100 %) and CO2 conversion (73.9 %) at 350 C-degrees owing to its highest basic sites and H-2 chemisorption capacity. The performance of this Dy-promoted catalyst diluted with different amounts of SiC, which was employed as a microwave susceptor and high thermal conductive dilution material, was also investigated in both microwave and electric reactor. Microwave heating leads to higher CO2 conversion compared to electric heating, regardless of reaction temperature and dilution factor due to selective heating and the random occurrence of hot spots, which are usually considered as micro -plasmas in the catalyst bed. However, further increase quantity of SiC decreased both CO2 conversion and CH4 selectivity regardless of heating method. This may be attributed to the appearance of extreme overheating and the absence of gentle overheating with increased amount of SiC in the microwave and electric reactors, respectively. The temperature -programmed oxidation results demonstrated that carbon deposition on the 0.5 %Dy-10 %Ni/SiC-SiO2 catalyst during 30 h of reaction can be significantly suppressed by microwave.

AB  - Temperature is one of the most critical factors affecting cassava metabolism and growth. This research was conducted to investigate the effects of short-term exposure to extreme cool (15 degrees C) and hot (45 degrees C) temperature on photosynthesis, biochemical and proteomics changes in potted plants of two cassava cultivars, namely Rayong 9 and Kasetsart 50. One-month-old plants were exposed to 15, 30, and 45 degrees C for 60 min in a temperature chamber under light intensity of 700 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Compared to the optimum temperature (30 degrees C), exposure to 15 degrees C resulted in 28% reduction in stomatal conductance (gs) and 62% reduction in net photosynthesis rate (P-n). In contrast, gs under 45 degrees C increased 2.61 folds, while P-n was reduced by 50%. The lower P-n but higher electron transport rate (ETR) of the cold-stressed plants indicated that a greater proportion of electrons was transported via alternative pathways to protect chloroplast from being damaged by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, a marker related to the amount of ROS, were significantly higher at low temperature. Proteomics analysis revealed some interesting differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) including annexin, a multi-functional protein functioning in early events of heat stress signaling. In response to low-temperature stress, AP2/ERF domain-containing protein (a cold-related transcription factor) and glutaredoxin domain-containing protein (a component of redox signaling network under cold stress) were detected. Taken together, both cultivars were more sensitive to low than high temperature. Moreover, Rayong 9 displayed higher P-n under both temperature stresses, and was more efficient in controlling ROS under cold stress than Kasetsart 50.

AB  - Heating load and cooling load forecasting are crucial for estimating energy consumption and improvement of energy performance during the design phase of buildings. Since the capacity of cooling ventilation and air-conditioning system of the building contributes to the operation cost, it is ideal to develop accurate models for heating and cooling load forecasting of buildings. This paper proposes a machine-learning technique for prediction of heating load and cooling load of residential buildings. The proposed model is deep neural network (DNN), which presents a category of learning algorithms that adopt nonlinear extraction of information in several steps within a hierarchical framework, primarily applied for learning and pattern classification. The output of DNN has been compared with other proposed methods such as gradient boosted machine (GBM), Gaussian process regression (GPR) and minimax probability machine regression (MPMR). To develop DNN model, the energy data set has been divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets. The performance of proposed model was benchmarked by statistical performance metrics such as variance accounted for (VAF), relative average absolute error (RAAE), root means absolute error (RMAE), coefficient of determination (R-2), standard deviation ratio (RSR), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NS), root means squared error (RMSE), weighted mean absolute percent error (WMAPE) and mean absolute percentage Error (MAPE). DNN and GPR have produced best-predicted VAF for cooling load and heating load of 99.76% and 99.84% respectively.

AB  - Laser machining has been emerging as a powerful alternative for cutting thin metal substrates. In this study, the application of pulsed laser cutting of a thin nonoriented silicon steel, with a thickness of 0.1 mm, was studied. The four processing parameters considered were laser power, cutting speed, pulse repetition rate, and processing environment. The two outputs to be measured were the extent of heat-affected zone (HAZ) and deviation of magnetic flux density (MFD) from initial value. Each input was designed with three levels and the three processing environments were air, deionized water, and sodium chloride solution. Based on the experimental design of the L-27 Taguchi method, 27 parameter sets out of the total of 81 sets were used for the experiment. Results show that HAZ and MFD were negatively correlated. Compared with processing in air, cutting in the liquid could effectively reduce the HAZ. In the 27 experimental cases, the achieved minimum HAZ was 34.5 mu m that corresponded to retaining 99% of initial MFD. The importance of the input was analyzed by the random forest method. The most and second significant parameters were laser power and environmental condition and their importance levels were 50.82% and 40.99%, respectively. Four artificial intelligence (AI) prediction models, full quadratic multiple regression analysis, artificial neural network, random forest, and extreme learning machine (ELM), were established based on randomly selecting 80% of the 27 data sets for training and the remaining 20% for testing. Model verification was executed by arbitrarily taking 10 additional new predictive parameter sets, from the remaining 54 parameter sets, for experiments. After comparing the predicting and experimental results, ELM model was found to have the best forecast performance. Thus, it was chosen as the target model for output optimization by the genetic algorithm method (GA). Through implementing the predicted optimal processing parameters from the resulting ELM-GA algorithm for the confirmation experiment, the obtained MFD and HAZ were 1.639 T and 30.41 mu m, respectively, which were very close to that of the predicted optimal outputs, 1.640 T for MFD and 29.90 mu m for HAZ.

AB  - The electrical output of photovoltaic (PV) modules degrades with continued exposure to extreme temperatures caused by solar radiation. The uniqueness of this research lies in the utilization of multidirectional fins with varying heights, which effectively accelerate heat transfer in PV cooling systems by inducing a transition in the boundary layer within the confined zone of the fins. The research aims to investigate the effect of using Multidirectional Tapered Fin Heat Sinks (MTFHS) to improve the efficiency of PV modules by utilizing aluminum alloy material as heatsinks. The proposed multidirectional design aims to facilitate enhanced heat transfer by promoting airflow in the central area of the PV module. The experimental procedures in our study differ from previous research as we utilized the latest generation of PV modules (405 Wp, PERC Half-cut cells) to fill the discrepancy between laboratory-based investigations and practical applications. Two PV modules were tested for an outdoor parametric analysis under outdoor operating conditions, with solar irradiance recorded from 200 to 1000 W/m2 and ambient temperatures ranging from 26 degrees to 38 degrees C. Findings indicated that the proposed MTFHS could lower PV module temperatures by 12 0C. Reduced temperature boosts PV module efficiency by 1.53%. Cooling advancements proved vital in contributing to sustainability in PV system installations.

AB  - agents used to treat or manage diseases can modify the level of heat strain ex-perienced by chronically ill and elderly patients via dif-ferent mechanistic pathways. Human thermoregulation is a crucial homeostatic process that maintains body tem-perature within a narrow range during heat stress through dry (i.e., increasing skin blood flow) and evapo-rative (i.e., sweating) heat loss, as well as active inhibition of thermogenesis, which is crucial to avoid overheating. Medications can independently and synergistically inter-act with aging and chronic disease to alter homeostatic responses to rising body temperature during heat stress. This review focuses on the physiologic changes, with spe-cific emphasis on thermolytic processes, associated with medication use during heat stress. The review begins by providing readers with a background of the global chronic disease burden. Human thermoregulation and aging effects are then summarized to give an understand-ing of the unique physiologic changes faced by older adults. The effects of common chronic diseases on tem-perature regulation are outlined in the main sections. Physiologic impacts of common medications used to treat these diseases are reviewed in detail, with emphasis on the mechanisms by which these medications alter ther-molysis during heat stress. The review concludes by providing perspectives on the need to understand the ef-fects of medication use in hot environments, as well as a summary table of all clinical considerations and research needs of the medications included in this review.Significance Statement--Long-term medications modulate thermoregulatory function, resulting in ex-cess physiological strain and predisposing patients to adverse health outcomes during prolonged exposures to extreme heat during rest and physical work (e.g., exercise). Understanding the medication-specific mech-anisms of altered thermoregulation has importance in both clinical and research settings, paving the way for work toward refining current medication prescription recommendations and formulating mitigation strategies for adverse drug effects in the heat in chronically ill patients.

AB  - Extreme heat treatments of canned coconut milk might reduce overall product quality. Therefore, an ohmicassisted thermal sterilizer (OATS) may be able to preserve packaged coconut milk as an alternative to an overpressure retort. OATS involves converting electrical energy immediately into heat inside medium, which is then transferred to the food packages. This differs from conventional retorts which relied primarily on heat transfer. To ensure food safety, the OATS was microbiologically validated using Clostridium sporogenes spores. Physicochemical property and aroma compound profile differences in coconut milk sterilized at F0 of 5.2 min using OATS were compared with conventional water spray retort. OATS completely inactivated C. sporogenes spores with more than 5 log CFU/mL at 121.1 degrees C for 5 min. The total processing time for OATS was 27 min using 32% less energy compared to the 42 min for the retort, indicating the higher process efficiency of OATS. OATS food products surpassed conventional retort properties in appearance, with minor color changes; off-odor, having a lower cooked odor by reducing methyl-ketone and Maillard reaction products; and desired aromas, by preserving contributors such as ethyl octanoate and 6-lactones. Consequently, OATS could potentially produce sterile coconut milk with minimal changes in appearance while decreasing off-odor formation.

AB  - Accurate prediction of the average thermal extraction load (ATEL) in hydrothermal heating systems optimizes energy recovery, though numerical models are constrained by modeling accuracy and computational time costs. Data-driven modeling can efficiently screen alternative production plans and enhance daily operational decisions. However, ensemble learning applications for forecasting ATEL lack comprehensive comparisons and appropriate algorithm selection. This study evaluates six ensemble learning algorithms: random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting machine (LightBGM) and categorical boosting (CatBoost) on 1159 data points from a homogeneous thermal-hydraulic coupling numerical model. The superior performance of the CatBoost is characterized by the highest accuracy (with the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 150.6 kW-170.7 kW, minimal mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.66%-0.73%, and exceptional R2 values of 0.999), commendable stability, reasonable computational cost and low uncertainty. LightGBM, XGBoost, and GBDT are identified as suitable substitutes, whereas RF is a possible substitute. Moreover, the production rate is identified as the most significant factor contributing to the ATEL, followed by the well spacing and injection temperature. While perforation depth has the least influence on heat recovery.

AB  - Climate-change futures provide a platform for low-carbon portfolios and energy market risk hedging. Climate changes induce uncertainty in energy-commodity markets. We investigate the potential of diversifying and hedging energy-commodity market risk with climate-change futures, using dynamic conditional correlation (DCC)-ordinary least squares (OLS) incorporating quantile-dummies and cross-quantilogram (CQ) approaches. DCC-OLS models reveal that the World and USA climate-change futures exhibit that they can be diversifiers for oil, ethanol, gasoil, and gasoline. These futures also exhibit hedging features for natural gas, coal, and heating oil. Euro climate-change futures demonstrate hedging capabilities for all energy commodities except oil and gasoil. World, USA, and Euro climate-change futures have the potential to serve as safe-haven financial instruments in the face of the high volatility of Brent crude oil, gasoil, and heating oil. The CQ reveals that World, USA, and Euro climate-change futures exhibit hedging and safe-haven capacity against oil, natural gas, coal, gasoil, gasoline, and heating futures. Climate-change futures may protect financial investments during extreme volatility in energy commodities.

AB  - Recently, the easily prepared catalysis used in CO2 electrochemical reduction with high selectivity and low cost has attracted more and more attention. Compared with the temperate wet chemical preparation method, which takes a long time and introduces some impurities, we found nickel metal catalysts can be easily and quickly synthesized on carbon black using the high-temperature shockwave method, which has the advantages of rapid heating up to 1300-1500 K within 0.5 s, no introduction of excess elements and extreme low unfavorable ni-trogen dopants. Heating cycles and proportion of nitrogen source have been investigated on the catalyst morphology, particle size and electrocatalysis performance. Based on operando X-ray absorption and aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements, nickel single atom catalysts (Ni SACs) were prepared successfully and uniformly in modest heating cycles and proportion of nitrogen source. The Ni SACs exhibited remarkable performance in reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) to carbon monoxide (CO), with the current density of 27.5 mA/cm2 (-1.0 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode) and CO selectivity approaching 100 % in flow cell.

AB  - This paper aims to assess changes in the extreme climate indices of the Lower Songkhram River Basin of Thailand under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios. A linear scaling method was used to correct climate data bias in three Regional Climate Models (RCMs) under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. Thereafter, extreme climate indices related to temperature and rainfall were analysed for the wet and dry seasons in upstream and downstream areas of the basin. A total of 14 climate indices were analysed for three time periods: the 2030s (2020-2044), 2055s (2045-2069), and 2080s (2070-2094) and compared with the baseline climate from 1980-2004. The results show that considerable variability is expected in the extreme climate of the basin in future. The average annual and monthly maximum and minimum temperature is projected to increase, with a lesser increase in the near future and higher in the far future. Heat events (TXx, TXn) are projected to increase while the cold events (TNx, TNn) are projected to decrease in both dry and wet seasons upstream and downstream of the basin. The future average annual rainfall in the basin is projected to decrease under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios for all three periods. However, the variability in average monthly rainfall is expected to increase in the dry season (Jan-May) and decrease in the wet (Aug-Dec). The most intense rainfall in one day (RX1Day) and five consecutive days (RX5Day) in the wet season is observed to increase in future, with a higher increase in the near future and a lower increase in the far future. The very heavy rainfall days (R20) (the number of days receiving more than 20 mm/day in the basin) are observed to decrease in both wet and dry seasons under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios in both locations. The results of this study will be helpful for the planning and management of natural resources as well as disaster risk reduction in the Lower Songkhram River Basin.

AB  - Presently, limited studies are available in understanding the ionic wind's behaviour under restricted or extreme environmental conditions. Thus, this study aims to investigate ionic wind characteristics and its convective heat transfer enhancement under the influence of varying air pressures. Here, an ionic wind generated from a cone to mesh configuration was used. Results showed that the discharge current (which translates to power consumption) and velocity of the ionic wind behaved in opposing manners at pressures above and below atmospheric pressure. Increasing the pressure above the atmospheric pressure led to a decrease in velocity for both positive and negative ionic wind, while the wind velocity was relatively constant at air pressures below atmospheric pressure. On the other hand, the power consumption was also seen to be consistent for positive ionic wind, while the negative ionic wind showed a power consumption decline with increasing air pressure. The highest power consumption was observed for the negative ionic wind at the lowest air pressure. Further investigations on the convective heat transfer showed a maximum achievable enhancement of 17% over natural convection for both positive and negative ionic wind. The optimum performance, which is defined as the heat transfer enhancement ratio over power consumption of the ionic wind, was found to be at just beneath the atmospheric pressure at 0.9 bar for both positive and negative ionic wind, with the positive ionic wind superseding the efficiency of negative ionic wind by 17%.

AB  - The international community has recognized global warming as an impending catastrophe that poses significant threat to life on earth. In response, the signatories of the Paris Agreement (2015) have committed to limit the increase in global mean temperature to <1.5 degrees C from pre-industry period, which is defined as 1850-1890. Considering that the protection of human life is a central focus in the Paris Agreement, the naturally endowed properties of the human body to protect itself from environmental extremes should form the core of an integrated and multifaceted solution against global warming. Scholars believe that heat and thermoregulation played important roles in the evolution of life and continue to be a central mechanism that allows humans to explore, labor and live in extreme conditions. However, the international effort against global warming has focused primarily on protecting the environment and on the reduction of greenhouse gases by changing human behavior, industrial practices and government policies, with limited consideration given to the nature and design of the human thermoregulatory system. Global warming is projected to challenge the limits of human thermoregulation, which can be enhanced by complementing innate human thermo-plasticity with the appropriate behavioral changes and technological innovations. Therefore, the primary aim of this review is to discuss the fundamental concepts and physiology of human thermoregulation as the underlying bases for human adaptation to global warming. Potential strategies to extend human tolerance against environmental heat through behavioral adaptations and technological innovations will also be discussed. An important behavioral adaptation postulated by this review is that sleep/wake cycles would gravitate towards a sub-nocturnal pattern, especially for outdoor activities, to avoid the heat in the day. Technologically, the current concept of air conditioning the space in the room would likely steer towards the concept of targeted body surface cooling. The current review was conducted using materials that were derived from PubMed search engine and the personal library of the author. The PubMed search was conducted using combinations of keywords that are related to the theme and topics in the respective sections of the review. The final set of articles selected were considered "state of the art," based on their contributions to the strength of scientific evidence and novelty in the domain knowledge on human thermoregulation and global warming.

AB  - CaSiO 3 perovskite is thought to be the third most abundant minerals in both the Earth's transition zone and lower mantle but its structural, thermodynamic, and elastic properties have not been well characterized. In this work, for the first time, we apply the statistical moment method (SMM) to determine analytical expressions of thermoelastic quantities such as isothermal and adiabatic elastic moduli, Gr & uuml;neisen parameter, Young's and shear moduli, compression wave and shear velocities including the full anharmonic effects of thermal lattice vibrations of perovskite crystals with cubic structure. The theoretical results are applied for numerical calculations for cubic CaSiO 3 perovskite, which is a strongly anharmonic system, at temperatures and pressures up to 4000 K and 180 GPa corresponding to the extreme conditions of the Earth's lower mantle. Our results for temperature and pressure dependences of unit cell volume, thermal expansivity, isochoric and isobaric heat capacities, Gr & uuml;neisen parameter, isothermal and adiabatic elastic moduli, Young's and shear moduli, compression wave and shear velocities are important signs of anharmonic effects under high temperatures and pressures. The SMM results are compared with experiments and other calculations. The present study provides an effective theoretical approach for finding the structural, thermodynamic, and elastic properties of strongly anharmonic materials under extreme conditions.

AB  - Climate change exacerbates extreme heat events in the North Africa and Arabian Peninsula (NAAP) region, posing a significant threat to human health and well-being. This study proposes a novel approach for reliable mapping of population exposure in NAAP to different UTCI levels under future climate change scenarios by improved prediction of UTCI using machine learning (ML) methods. Daily mean UTCI was calculated using hourly ERA-HEAT data from 1979 to 2022. Sobol's global sensitivity analysis was used to identify the most influential meteorological variables affecting UTCI. Three ML models were trained to predict monthly UTCI based on these variables. The best-performing model was used to generate historical and future projections of UTCI for four CMIP6 climate models under Paris Agreement goal scenarios. Finally, the projected change in population exposure to mean UTCI was assessed by comparing historical and future projections. The results showed a significant influence of air temperature, wind speed, surface pressure, solar radiation, and humidity on UTCI in NAAP. Estimation of UTCI using these variables showed a higher performance of random forest (RF) (Kling-Gupta Efficiency = 0.84) compared to other models. The projection of UTCI from CMIP6 climatic model simulations using the RF model revealed a decrease in UTCI for the 1.5 degrees C temperature rise scenario by 0.25-0.75 degrees C, while an increase by 0.25-0.75 degrees C for the 2.0 degrees C temperature rise scenario in most of NAAP. The study revealed that even a modest increase of 0.5 degrees C in global warming could lead to a 20-day increase in the number of days with moderate thermal stress in Egypt and Sudan and a significant increase in the number of days with strong thermal stress in the Arabian Peninsula. The population exposure to heat stress would increase significantly even under the most ambitious Paris Agreement goals. These findings highlight the urgent need for adaptation and mitigation strategies to protect public health and well-being in the NAAP region from escalating risks.

AB  - Doping enhances diamond like carbon (DLC) coatings for extreme high-temperature applications. However, understanding the enhancement mechanism is elusive. This study employs a novel system integrating Raman spectroscopy and depth-sensing indentation with a heating chamber to monitor chemical structural, and mechanical properties of doped and un-doped hydrogenated DLC films, with temperature. This in-situ investigation represents extreme working conditions, revealing how doping enhances DLC films thermal stability. It is shown that the thermal stability of the a-C:H:Si films could be maximized by increasing the Si content. The film with the highest Si content was stable until 650 C while the films with lower Si or No-Si content graphitized at lower temperatures. This study presents hardness measurement under high-temperature conditions that were not available before. In-situ observations reveal how Si doping correlates with stability of mechanical properties at elevated temperatures. The correlation of the mechanical properties with W-G reveals that the mechanism of thermal stability is that Si doping makes the film resistant to graphitization by promoting sp(3) hybridization. Furthermore, our in situ approach makes it possible to conduct characterization that emulates real service conditions, and therefore, our results show great potential of the industrial application of DLC coatings in extreme thermal conditions.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the impact of climate change on heat-related mortality in Southeast Asia in the future. The ensemble mean from five General Circulation Models (GCMs) including the Flexible Global Ocean-Atmosphere-Land System Model: Grid-Point Version 3 (FGOALS-g3), Max Planck Institute Earth System Model Version 1.2 (MPI-ESM1-2-LR), EC-Earth3, The Meteorological Research Institute Earth System Model Version 2.0 (MRI-ESM2-0), and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Earth System Model Version 4 (GFDL-ESM4) was used to project severe temperatures and heat indices in Southeast Asia under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects Phase 6 (CMIP6). This data was used to correlate with mortality data from the Global Burden of Disease database to quantify heat-related mortality in the region. The ensemble mean results show a reasonable level of accuracy in capturing temperature patterns in the Southeast Asian region with an R2 of 0.96, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.84 and a standard deviation of residual (SDR) of 0.02. When compared to the baseline (1990-2019), temperature extreme indices are rising across all climatic scenarios, with a substantial increase in the SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, ranging from 10% to 50% over the regions, with the heat index predicted to peak in the middle of the century. The two low-emission scenarios, SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5, on the other hand, anticipate more moderate increases, indicating a potentially less severe impact on the region. As a result, under high-emission scenarios, there is expected to be a significant increase in heat-related mortality across Southeast Asia. The expected impact is estimated to affect between 200 and 300 people per 100,000 people from 2030 to 2079, accordingly. Our results highlight the critical need to address health-related impacts of climate change in this region.

AB  - Radiative cooling, taking advantage of the coldness of the sky, has a potential to be a sustainable alternative to meet cooling needs. The performance of a radiative cooling device is fundamentally limited by the emissivity of the sky, therefore depends heavily on the regional weather conditions. Although the sky emissivity is known to increase with the dew point temperature, the feasibility of radiative cooling remains elusive in the equatorial tropical climate, where the weather is humid, cloudy and constantly changing. We point out that a high degree of thermal insulation of the radiative cooling system can be effective under such extreme weather conditions. A new method to characterise dynamic sky conditions is presented, namely to measure the sky window emissivity in the zenith direction. We show that a sub-ambient cooling up to 8 degrees C is possible during daytime and that the cloud base is not a complete blackbody and can be used as a heat sink for radiative cooling.

AB  - Phase change materials (PCMs) have received widespread thermal energy storage (TES) and release properties due to their unique characteristics. However, the PCMs suffer from poor thermal conductivity, resulting in the least thermal performance and heat transfer characteristics. This research focused on enhancing the heat transfer and storage characteristics by developing an organic paraffin wax composite by dispersing highly conductive graphene powder using a two-step technique. The results show that the developed nano enhanced PCM significantly improves the thermal conductivity by 72.2% at 0.6 wt% of graphene powder. Furthermore, the Fourier transform infrared spectrum shows there is no additional peak observed, means physically and chemically stable, and the reduced light transmission capability was enhanced by 32.0% than pure PCM. Due to its extreme characteristics, the developed PCM is an outstanding material for medium temperature solar thermal energy storage applications.

AB  - In the current investigation, the heat transfer development with the turbulent flow of novel metal oxide-based ternary composite nanofluids of ZnO + Al2O3+TiO2/DW at varying wt.% concentrations (0.025, 0.05, 0.075, and 0.1) in a square heat exchanger below constant heat flux conditions was discussed. The new ternary composite nanofluids were synthesized by using the sonochemical technique. The ZnO + Al2O3+TiO2/DW based ternary composite nanofluids with their respective wt. % reveals an enhancement in effective thermal conductivity and heat transfer coefficient local and average with Reynolds numbers varying from 4550 to 20,367. The extreme growth in overall effective thermal conductivity was noticed up to 1.149 W/m-K at 0.1 wt% for ternary hybrid composite nanofluids at a maximum temperature 45 degrees C. Similarly, at 0.075 wt%, 0.05 wt%, and 0.025 wt % the overall effective thermal conductivity was recorded 1.118 W/m-K, 1.091 W/m-K, and 1.079 W/m-K correspondingly, which is greater than that of base fluid (DW), with improved thermo-physical characteristics for novel ZnO + Al2O3+TiO2/DW ternary hybrid composite nanofluids. Also, it shows an improvement in local and average heat transfer with a maximum growth of 0.1 wt %. The maximum heat transfer was observed for ZnO + Al2O3+TiO2/DW based Ternary hybrid composite nanofluids at 0.1 wt % concentrations, up to 900-5700 W/m(2)K, which is 89% higher than distilled water. While, an enhancement of 900-3870 W/m(2)K, 900-3350 W/m(2)K, 900-2750 W/m(2)K were observed for the other three wt. % 0.075, 0.05 and 0.025, respectively. The study revealed that the metal oxide based ternary hybrid composites nanofluids are suitable for nano coolant applications due to improved thermophysical characteristics and also it is applicable for energy management in industrial applications.

AB  - Gas turbine engines play a crucial role in numerous industrial domains, including power generation, aviation, and marine propulsion. One of the major challenges in designing gas turbine engines is managing the high temperature generated by the combustion process. Internal cooling is a commonly used technique to maintain the temperature of critical components, such as turbine blades, within a safe operating range. Rib turbulators are widely used in internal cooling systems to enhance heat transfer performance by promoting turbulence in the fluid flow. Nevertheless, the existence of a continuous rib within the cooling channel can result in elevated temperatures near the rib section, potentially diminishing the overall system efficiency. In response to this challenge, a new rib turbulator design, denoted as the "separated rib," has been introduced to mitigate the high-temperature zone. Through the utilization of the passing-gap design in the separated rib configuration, the coolant flow passes through the gap, effectively eliminating the region of extreme heat and augmenting the secondary flow. Consequently, it results in a notable enhancement of heat transfer performance within the ribbed channel. The numerical simulations are performed by solving three-dimensional (3D) Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations using the commercial software ANSYS CFX. The working fluid is steam, and the heat transfer performance is evaluated in terms of the Nusselt number (Nu), friction factor (f), and thermal performance factor (TPF). The results show that the separated rib configuration has approximately 17.3% higher Nusselt number than the original ribbed configuration when the Reynolds number (Re) changes from 5000 to 60 000. The separated rib configuration consistently shows higher TPF values between about 1.6 and 1.9 than the original rib configuration, where TPF is smaller than 1.35. Furthermore, the heat transfer correlation related to the Reynolds number was developed to predict heat transfer performance. The heat transfer correlations align closely with the numerical simulation results, showing about 17.4% and 34.3% improvements in Nu and TPF, respectively, for our newly designed system compared to the old version.

AB  - This paper experimentally and numerically investigated the thermal performance of cementitious composites containing polystyrene/n-octadecane microcapsules (MPCM-CCs). The focus was placed on the passive cooling and heating, and the peak load reduction and shifting of MPCM-CCs subjected to extreme temperature conditions (10-50 degrees C). Adding microcapsules with a latent heat of 142.9 J/g effectively improved the heat storage and thermal insulation performance of MPCM-CCs, thereby mitigating the temperature fluctuations of inner surface and indoor air by up to 17.5 degrees C and 10.7 degrees C, respectively. The peak load was reduced and shifted by up to 260 W/m(2) and 675 s in the heating process (1130 s), and 436 W/m(2) and 465 s in the cooling process (1750 s). Further, this study evaluated the influence of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) scanning rate on the phase change properties of microcapsules and the consistency between the simulation and experimental results of MPCM-CCs. Due to the low thermal conductivity of polystyrene shell, the phase change temperatures of microcapsules varied significantly with DSC scanning rates. Consequently, the simulation results based on improper scanning rates deviated from the experimental results, which highlights the importance of considering the difference between the temperature change rates of building components and DSC analysis.

AB  - High strength steel (HSS) has gained its popularity in high-rise and large-span structures in which fire is one of the extreme scenarios that needs to be considered in structural design. In view of different types of HSS manufactured from different heat-treatment processes, their mechanical behaviours under fire would be different. However, previous studies and modern design codes show inadequacy of information on their temperature-dependent mechanical properties, especially their mechanical differences due to the different heat-treatment methods. With the research gap being identified, high-temperature coupon tests were conducted on two types of 5690 steel respectively manufactured from thermo-mechanically controlled process (TMCP) and quenching and tempering (QT) process. Both steady- and transient-state test methods were adopted. Microstructure changes were discussed and temperature-dependent mechanical properties were compared with each other and with those of mild steel produced through hot-rolling process. The test results revealed that TMCP-5690 steel exhibited similar elastic modulus at elevated temperatures as QT-5690 steel but smaller effective yield strengths when the thermal creep was more significant above 400 degrees C. Through this study, the heat-treatment dependent thermal elongations, elastic moduli and effective yield strengths at elevated temperatures were recommended for fire resistant design of HSS structural elements. The stress-strain constitutive model was also provided for numerical modelling. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Conventional surfactants such as CTAB (cetrimonium bromide), SDS (sodium dodecyl sulphate), SDBS (sodium dodecyl sulphonate) are combined with nanofluids to improve the stability and thermal conductivity of nanofluids. These nanofluids are mainly used for heat transfer applications where heating and cooling are usual courses of action which result in surfactants producing foams and polluting the heat transfer media, affecting the total system performance. Besides, the common surfactant molecules that augment the thermal resistance between the nanoparticles and base fluid also affect the thermophysical properties of the nanofluid. In this paper, [Bmim][Cl] (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride), a high purity ionic liquid (IL) with higher thermal stability was used to provide a comparative study on the stability and thermal properties with that of the conventional surfactants (CTAB, SDS, SDBS) on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT)/propylene glycol (PG) nanofluid. The transient hot-wire based KD2-Pro and zeta potential results demonstrated that the inclusion of ionic liquid improved the thermal conductivity and stability of the formulated nanofluid. However, much like the conventional surfactants, the strong electrostatic repulsive force created by the ionic liquid was found to decrease when the temperature is increased. The outcome demonstrated the most extreme thermal conductivity upgrade of 33.7% at 303 K and maximum dispersion stability of more than one month without any aggregation for the nanofluid containing ionic liquid.

AB  - Background: Health effects associated with extreme temperature and elevated air pollutants have been concerns. The present study examined mortality from and morbidity of chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated with extreme temperature and exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O-3) by sex and age in 2005-2016 in metropolitans of Taiwan. Methods: The distributed lag non-linear model was applied to analyze roles of extreme high (99th percentile) and low (5th percentile) temperatures, and 90th percentile PM2.5 and ozone (O3) in association with CKD risks of deaths, emergency room visits (ERVs), and outpatient visits by age (40-64 and 65 years and above) and sex. Pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all studied areas were estimated using random -effects meta-analysis. Results: Cold spells (< 14 C) showed a higher risk on mortality from CKD for the elderly. Middle-aged population was more vulnerable to high temperature (31.3 C) with the highest risk for women admitted to outpatient visits [RR = 1.25; (95% CI; 1.17-1.34)]. Women aged 65 years and above had the highest risk after exposing to higher levels of PM2.5 (55 mu g/m(3)) [RR = 1.07; (95% CI; 1.03-1.12)] and O-3 (43 ppb) [RR = 1.07; (95% CI; 1.00-1.15)]. Conclusions: The elderly CKD patients were more prone to the adverse effect of low temperature and high levels of PM2.5 and O-3. Middle aged groups were more prone to health risks related to the high temperature. Men are more susceptible to the high temperature, meanwhile women are sensitive to higher levels of PM2.5 and O-3.

AB  - Climate change has been projected to increase the intensity and magnitude of extreme temperature in Indonesia. Solar radiation management (SRM) has been proposed as a strategy to temporarily combat global warming, buying time for negative emissions. Although the global impacts of SRM have been extensively studied in recent years, regional impacts, especially in the tropics, have received much less attention. This article investigates the potential stratospheric sulphate aerosol injection (SAI) to modify mean and extreme temperature, as well as the relative humidity and wet bulb temperature (WBT) change over Indonesian Maritime Continent (IMC) based on simulations from three different earth system models. We applied a simple downscaling method and corrected the bias of model output to reproduce historical temperatures and relative humidity over IMC. We evaluated changes in geoengineering model intercomparison project (GeoMIP) experiment G4, an SAI experiment in 5 Tg of SO2 into the equatorial lower stratosphere between 2020 and 2069, concurrent with the RCP4.5 emissions scenario. G4 is able to significantly reduce the temperature means and extremes, and although differences in magnitude of response and spatial pattern occur, there is a generally consistent response. The spatial response of changes forced by RCP4.5 scenario and G4 are notably heterogeneous in the archipelago, highlighting uncertainties that would be critical in assessing socio-economic consequences of both doing, and not doing G4. In general, SAI has bigger impacts in reducing temperatures over land than oceans, and the southern monsoon region shows more variability. G4 is also effective at reducing the likelihood of WBT > 27 degrees C events compared with RCP4.5 after some years of SAI deployment as well as during the post-termination period of SAI. Regional downscaling may be an effective tool in obtaining policy-relevant information about local effects of different future scenarios involving SAI.

AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the effect of urbanization on the surface air temperature (SAT) from 1951 to 2018 in the Philippines. The daily minimum temperature (T-min) and daily maximum temperature (T-max) records from 34 meteorological stations were used to derive extreme temperature indices. These stations were then classified as urban or rural based on satellite night-lights. The results showed a significant difference in the SAT trends between urban and rural stations, indicative of the effect of urbanization in the country. Larger and more significant warming trends were observed in indices related to T-min than those related to T-max. In particular, the effects of urbanization were significant in the annual index series of T-min, diurnal temperature range, minimum T-min, percentage of days when T-min was less than the 10th percentile (T-N10p), percentage of days when T-min was greater than 90th percentile (T-N90p), and the number of coldest nights. The effects of urbanization were not as clear on the index series of maximum T-max (T-Xx), minimum T-max (T-Xn), percentage of days when T-max was less than 10th percentile (T-X10p), and the number of hottest days. The effects of urbanization on the annual series of extreme temperature indices were statistically significant at the 95% confidence level, with the exception of T-max, T-Xn, T-Xx, T-X10p, and the number of hottest days. Further analysis revealed that the effect of urbanization was the greatest during the DJF (December-January-February) season. These findings serve as a baseline study that focuses on the countrywide effect of urbanization on SAT trends in the Philippines.

AB  - Many cities aim to progress toward their sustainability and public health goals by increasing use of their public transit systems. However, without adequate protective infrastructure that provides thermally comfortable conditions for public transit riders, it can be challenging to reach these goals in hot climates. We took micrometeorological measurements and surveyed riders about their perceptions of heat and heat-coping behaviors at bus stops with a variety of design attributes in Phoenix, AZ, USA, during the summer of 2018. We identified the design attributes and coping behaviors that made riders feel cooler. We observed that current infrastructure standards and material choices for bus stops in Phoenix are insufficient to provide thermal comfort, and can even expose riders to health risks. Almost half of the study participants felt hot or very hot at the time they were surveyed, and more than half reported feeling thermally uncomfortable. On average, shade reduced the physiological equivalent temperature (PET) by 19 degrees C. Moreover, we found significant diurnal differences in PET reductions from the shade provided by various design attributes. For instance, all design attributes were effective in reducing PET in the morning; however, a vegetated awning did not provide statistically significant shade reductions in the afternoon. Temperatures of sun-exposed surfaces of man-made materials exceeded skin burn thresholds in the afternoon, but shade was effective in bringing the same surfaces to safe levels. Aesthetically pleasing stops were rated as cooler than stops rated as less beautiful. We conclude that cities striving to increase public transit use should prioritize thermal comfort when designing public transit stops in hot climates.

AB  - Indonesia is one of the countries that has a tropical climate. With the weather and extreme temperatures occurring, almost all buildings use air conditioner to get the thermal comfort. Phase Change Material (PCM), a Thermal Energy Storage (TES) with latent heat working principle, can be an alternative in reducing energy consumption due to the use of air conditioner in the building. The purpose of this research is to determine the characteristics of thermal properties in building materials integrated with PCM material, namely, beeswax. The study is done by conducting thermal properties testing to determine the effect of adding a beeswax to the building material to the resulting temperature and compared to the building material without the addition of beeswax. Variations of this research is the temperature of heater as heat source (35, 40, 45 degrees C). The results of the study showed that the addition of beeswax resulted in a lower inner wall temperature compared to those not added by beeswax. The thermal conductivity of beeswax-concrete composite obtained from the test result are 0.0211-0.0212 W/m degrees C and the composite diffusivity at 2.89x10(-6) m(2)/s. This proves that by adding PCM to the building material, the PCM will absorb the heat and the heat that enter the room will be reduced.

TI  - Patterns and drivers of heavy and extreme hourly rainfall events over Metro Manila, Philippines
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - TROPICAL CYCLONES
AB  - This study investigates the spatio-temporal characteristics of heavy hourly rainfall (HHR; 95th-99th percentile) and extreme hourly rainfall (EHR; >99th percentile) events over Metro Manila, Philippines, and quantifies the percentage contributions of synoptic scale (Tropical Cyclones (TCs) and Low Pressure Systems (LPSs; weaker disturbances than TCs)) and local scale systems (convective and stratiform rainfall events) to the total HHR and EHR, during the southwest monsoon season from 2012 to 2019. The results show higher mean rainfall intensities for both HHR and EHR events in stations located further inland and close to mountainous areas. An evident afternoon peak is observed for both HHR and EHR events possibly caused by the diurnal heating over land. A secondary peak is also observed in the early morning hours for HHR events, which is likely caused by the convergence between the local wind circulations and the prevailing monsoon southwesterlies. Both HHR and EHR events are dominated by short-duration events (1-2 h) (HHR: 69-82%, EHR: 77-94%) across all stations, with higher percentages in stations located further inland near the mountainous regions. On the other hand, the contributions from medium-duration (3-5 h) (HHR: 15-26%, EHR: 4-23%) and long-duration events (>= 6 h) (HHR: 3-9%, EHR: 0-6%) are smaller, with higher percentages located in northern stations. The majority of HHR events (52-60%) are found to be caused by stratiform rainfall, while the EHR events are mostly caused by convective rainfall events (38-72%). The contribution from TCs (LPSs) ranges from 37 to 46% (2-4%) for the HHR and 24-47% (0-5%) for the EHR events, respectively. These insights on the spatio-temporal variation of heavy and extreme rainfall events can be used in better understanding the characteristics of rainfall extremes in Metro Manila. {GRAPHIACAL ABSTRACT}

AB  - Solar energy is a harmless form of energy that is plentiful. Due to the extreme usefulness of solar energy, it is used in applications like solar collectors (SCs). The application leads to this research that focuses specifically on the inclined magnetically driven Maxwell nanofluid flow on an endless plate. The Maxwell nanofluid flows past over an exponentially uniform, horizontal porous stretchable plate inside the parabolic trough solar collector (PTSC). The essential exterior resources in PTSC like thermal radiative, viscous dissipative flow and Joule heating parameters are considered. Two common Maxwell nanofluids are always being used in the application are chosen in this research; Copper-methanol (Cu-Ch(3)OH) and Titanium-methanol (TiO2-Ch(3)OH) in this research. The governing equation in PDEs involved is converted into higher-order ODEs by utilizing the similarity variables. The converted ODEs are solved numerically by adopting the Kellerbox scheme. Based on the findings, Cu-Ch(3)OH nanofluid has better heat transfer compared to TiO2-Ch(3)OH. It is also found that the Cu-Ch(3)OH thermal efficiency can achieve a maximum of 29%.

AB  - Rigorous understanding of tunnel fire attributes and behavior of concrete at elevated temperatures are indispensable for conducting a numerical simulation of tunnel linings exposed to fire. One of the main feats of tunnel fires is, unlike cellulose fires, temperature of these fires quickly ascends to its zenith, which is higher than conventional cellulose fire temperature. Higher peak temperature in conjunction with rapid heating rate causes spalling in the tunnel linings, which is triggered by excess vapor pressure in concrete pores generated from evaporation of moisture in concrete. Apart from vaporization of moisture, multiple simultaneous physiochemical processes (dehydration/hydration, desorption/sorption, alpha-beta transformation of quartz, decarbonation) take place in concrete when it gets heated. Modelling of a tunnel fire using a commercial finite element tool without taking into account of these physiochemical processes and latent energy associated with the phase changes will result in inaccurate prediction of the results. Thus, the behavior of concrete tunnel liners in extreme fire conditions and relevant material parameters required for numerical simulation are presented in this paper.

AB  - PurposeAs global warming intensifies, climatic conditions are changing dramatically, potentially affecting specific businesses and cities' livability. The temperature increase in cities significantly affects urban residents whose percentage is to reach about 70% by 2050. This paper aimed at highlighting the climate change risks in cities, particularly focusing on the threats to people's health due to a continuous temperature increase. Design/methodology/approachThis study was conducted in three main steps. First, the literature review on the effects of climate change, particularly on the continuous temperature rise in cities, was conducted based on the publications retrieved from PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar and Research Gate. Second, the survey was conducted for the sample cities for one month. Third, the questionnaire was used to assess possible climate change threats to the livability of cities. FindingsThe findings showed that urban areas are usually warmer than the surrounding rural areas, mainly due to the urban heat island effect, causing more hot days in metropolitan areas compared to rural areas. This paper outlines some mitigation and adaptation measures, which can be implemented to improve the livability in cities, their sustainability and the well-being of their populations. Originality/valueThis study reports on the climate change impacts on the health and livability of 15 cities, in industrialized and developing countries. It examines the average and maximum temperature and relative humidity of each city and its correlation with their livability. It was complemented by a survey focused on 109 cities from Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, North America and Oceania.

AB  - The 2018 boreal summer in the Western North Pacific (WNP) is highlighted by 17 tropical cyclones (TC)-the highest record during the reported reliable years of TC observations. We contribute to the existing knowledge pool on this extreme TC frequency record by showing that the simultaneous highest recorded intensity of the WNP summer monsoon prompted the eastward extension of the monsoon trough and enhancement of tropical convective activities, which are both favorable for TC development. Such changes in the WNP summer monsoon environment led to the extreme TC frequency record during the 2018 boreal summer. Meanwhile, the highest record in TC frequency and the intensity of the WNP summer monsoon are both attributed with the combined increase in the anomalous westerlies originating from the cold tropical Indian Ocean sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies drawn towards the convective heat source that is associated with the warm central Pacific SST anomalies. Our results provide additional insights in characterizing above normal tropical cyclone and summer monsoon activities in the WNP in understanding seasonal predictable horizons in the WNP, and in support of disaster risk and impact reduction.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to evaluate the physiological adaptability of pregnant doe Kacang goats in a dryland area of Indonesia. Thirty pregnant doe Kacang goats aged 2-3 years were observed. The rearing system was semi-intensive without giving concentrated feeds. Local grasses and legumes such as Leucaena leucocephala leaves, Gliricidia sepium leaves, Sesbania grandiflora leaves, and drinking water were offered ad libitum. Experimental data such as respiration rate, rectal temperature, adaptability coefficient, heart rate, and heat tolerance coefficient, were collected during 2-3 months of gestation. The mean and standard deviation were calculated using a descriptive analysis method. The average humidity in the morning and afternoon and the ambient temperature in the middle of the day were outside the normal range. The THI value indicates that the experimental animals are under medium heat stress. The average values of HTC, AC, RT, HR, and RR were still typical for goats. In conclusion, although the average ambient temperature at midday and humidity in the morning and afternoon were outside of the normal range, they did not cause any effects on feed and water intake, health, and fetus growth and development of pregnant doe Kacang goats. This happened because the Kacang goat is a local breed that can adapt well to extreme environments. Therefore, pregnant doe Kacang goats in Malaka District can be allowed to graze in the paddock throughout the day and housed at night.

AB  - (1) Background: The health effect of temperature has become a rising public health topic. The objective of this study is to assess the association between apparent temperature and non-accidental deaths, and the mortality burden attributed to cold and heat temperature; (2) Methods: The daily data on temperature and deaths were collected from 10 cities in Thailand, Korea and China. We fitted a time-series regression with a distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) to derive the health risk of temperature for each city and then pooled them to get the overall cumulative risk by multivariate meta-analysis. Additionally, we calculated the attributable fraction of deaths for heat and cold, which was defined as temperatures above and below minimum-mortality temperature (MMT); (3) Results: There are regional heterogeneities in the minimum mortality percentiles (MMP) and attributable fractions for different countries. The MMP varied from about the 5-10th percentile in Thailand to 63-93rd percentile in China and Korea. The attributable fractions of the total deaths due to short-term exposure to temperature in Asia is 7.62%, of which the cold effect (6.44%) is much higher than the heat effect (1.18%); (4) Conclusions: Our study suggested that apparent temperature was associated with an increase in non-accidental mortality. Most of the temperature-related mortality burden was attributable to cold, except for Thailand.

AB  - BackgroundThe fishery and aquaculture of the widely distributed mangrove crab Scylla serrata is a steadily growing, high-value, global industry. Climate change poses a risk to this industry as temperature elevations are expected to threaten the mangrove crab habitat and the supply of mangrove crab juveniles from the wild. It is therefore important to understand the genomic and molecular basis of how mangrove crab populations from sites with different climate profiles respond to heat stress. Towards this, we performed RNA-seq on the gill tissue of S. serrata individuals sampled from 3 sites (Cagayan, Bicol, and Bataan) in the Philippines, under normal and heat-stressed conditions. To compare the transcriptome expression profiles, we designed a 2-factor generalized linear model containing interaction terms, which allowed us to simultaneously analyze within-site response to heat-stress and across-site differences in the response.ResultsWe present the first ever transcriptome assembly of S. serrata obtained from a data set containing 66 Gbases of cleaned RNA-seq reads. With lowly-expressed and short contigs excluded, the assembly contains roughly 17,000 genes with an N50 length of 2,366 bp. Our assembly contains many almost full-length transcripts - 5229 shrimp and 3049 fruit fly proteins have alignments that cover >80% of their sequence lengths to a contig. Differential expression analysis found population-specific differences in heat-stress response. Within-site analysis of heat-stress response showed 177, 755, and 221 differentially expressed (DE) genes in the Cagayan, Bataan, and Bicol group, respectively. Across-site analysis showed that between Cagayan and Bataan, there were 389 genes associated with 48 signaling and stress-response pathways, for which there was an effect of site in the response to heat; and between Cagayan and Bicol, there were 101 such genes affecting 8 pathways.ConclusionIn light of previous work on climate profiling and on population genetics of marine species in the Philippines, our findings suggest that the variation in thermal response among populations might be derived from acclimatory plasticity due to pre-exposure to extreme temperature variations or from population structure shaped by connectivity which leads to adaptive genetic differences among populations.

AB  - Dental caries is the most frequent dental health issue in the general population. Dental caries can result in extreme pain or infections, lowering people's quality of life. Applying machine learning models to automatically identify dental caries can lead to earlier treatment. However, physicians frequently find the model results unsatisfactory due to a lack of explainability. Our study attempts to address this issue with an explainable deep learning model for detecting dental caries. We tested three prominent pre-trained models, EfficientNet-B0, DenseNet-121, and ResNet-50, to determine which is best for the caries detection task. These models take panoramic images as the input, producing a caries-non-caries classification result and a heat map, which visualizes areas of interest on the tooth. The model performance was evaluated using whole panoramic images of 562 subjects. All three models produced remarkably similar results. However, the ResNet-50 model exhibited a slightly better performance when compared to EfficientNet-B0 and DenseNet-121. This model obtained an accuracy of 92.00%, a sensitivity of 87.33%, and an F1-score of 91.61%. Visual inspection showed us that the heat maps were also located in the areas with caries. The proposed explainable deep learning model diagnosed dental caries with high accuracy and reliability. The heat maps help to explain the classification results by indicating a region of suspected caries on the teeth. Dentists could use these heat maps to validate the classification results and reduce misclassification.

AB  - Internal waves (IWs) mitigate thermal stress and provide refugia for corals against increasingly frequent mass bleaching. However, climate events may bring uncertainty regarding the resistance of such refugia. Here, using in situ observation data in the Andaman Sea (AS), we conduct a case study in which a monsoon anomaly associated with an El Nino event threatens IW coral refugia. IW cooling in the AS coral reefs is modulated by the thermocline depth variation, which is driven, to a significant extent, by Kelvin wave signals from the equator. In the pre-monsoon period, distinct variations in IW cooling and surface heating form a time window of quickly-growing cumulative heat exposure. The El Nino induces a typical two-week delay of summer monsoon onset, which prolongs the duration of thermal stress growth and brings severe bleaching risk to corals. As global warming increases the frequency of extreme El Nino events, IW coral refugia will face great challenges in the future.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) approach was applied for the prediction of biocrude yields (BY) and higher heating values (HHV) from hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of wet biomass and wastes using 17 input features from feedstock characteristics (biological and elemental properties) and operating conditions. Several novel ML algorithms were evaluated, based on 10-fold cross-validation, with 3 different sets of input features. An extreme gradient boosting (XGB) model proved to give the best prediction accuracy at nearly 0.9 R2 with normal root mean square error (NRMSE) of 0.16 for BY and about 0.87 R2 with NRMSE of about 0.04 for HHV. Temperature was found to be the most influential feature on the predictions for both BY and HHV. Meanwhile, feedstock characteristics contributed to the XGB model for more than 55%. Individual effects and interactions of most important features on the predictions were also exposed, leading to better understanding of the HTL system.

AB  - Background Extreme panting under heat stress threatens dairy cattle milk production. Previous research has revealed that the gas exchange-mediated respiratory drive in critically ill dairy cattle with low O-2 saturation induces panting. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling may play important roles in immunosuppression and oxidative stress during severe respiratory stress responses in heat-stressed cattle. The objectives of this study were to transcriptomically analyze mRNA expression mediating heat-induced respiratory stress-associated panting, evaluate gas exchange, screen hub genes, and verify the expression of proteins encoded by differentially expressed genes in lymphocyte pathways. Results Jersey cattle were naturally heat-exposed. Physiological data were collected for response evaluation, and blood was collected for gas exchange and gene expression assays at 06:00, 10:00 and 14:00 continuously for 1 week. Lymphocytes were isolated from whole-blood samples for mRNA-seq and expression analysis of key pathway genes/proteins. The cattle respiration rates differed with time, averaging 51 bpm at 06:00, 76 bpm at 10:00, and 121 bpm at 14:00 (p < 0.05). Gas exchange analysis showed that both pH and pCO(2) differed with time: they were 7.41 and 41 mmHg at 06:00, 7.45 and 37.5 mmHg at 10:00, and 7.49 and 33 mmHg at 14:00, respectively (p < 0.01). Sixteen heat-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs; 13 upregulated and 3 downregulated) were screened between 212 DEGs and 1370 heat stress-affected genes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) hub gene functional analysis annotated eleven genes to signal transduction, six genes to the immune response, and five genes to the endocrine response, including both prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) and VEGF. Gene Ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis revealed that oxygen regulation was associated with the phosphorus metabolic process, response to oxygen levels, response to decreased oxygen levels, response to hypoxia and cytokine activity terms. The main signaling pathways were the VEGF, hypoxia inducible factor-1(HIF-1), cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and TNF pathways. Four genes involved Integrin beta 3 (ITBG3), PTGS2, VEGF, and myosin light chain 9 (MYL9) among the 16 genes related to immunosuppression, oxidative stress, and endocrine dysfunction were identified as participants in the VEGF signaling pathway and oxygenation. Conclusion These findings help elucidate the underlying immune and oxygen regulation mechanisms associated with the VEGF signaling pathway in heat-stressed dairy cattle.

AB  - The significance of accurate heating load (HL) approximation is the primary motivation of this research to distinguish the most efficient predictive model among several neural-metaheuristic models. The proposed models are formulated through synthesizing a multi-layer perceptron network (MLP) with ant lion optimization (ALO), biogeography-based optimization (BBO), the dragonfly algorithm (DA), evolutionary strategy (ES), invasive weed optimization (IWO), and league champion optimization (LCA) hybrid algorithms. Each ensemble is optimized in terms of the operating population. Accordingly, the ALO-MLP, BBO-MLP, DA-MLP, ES-MLP, IWO-MLP, and LCA-MLP presented their best performance for population sizes of 350, 400, 200, 500, 50, and 300, respectively. The comparison was carried out by implementing a ranking system. Based on the obtained overall scores (OSs), the BBO (OS = 36) featured as the most capable optimization technique, followed by ALO (OS = 27) and ES (OS = 20). Due to the efficient performance of these algorithms, the corresponding MLPs can be promising substitutes for traditional methods used for HL analysis.

AB  - Laser-assisted high speed milling is a subtractive machining method that employs a laser to thermally soften a difficult-to-cut material's surface in order to enhance machinability at a high material removal rate with improved surface finish and tool life. However, this machining with high speed leads to high friction between workpiece and tool, and can result in high temperatures, impairing the surface quality. Use of conventional cutting fluid may not effectively control the heat generation. Besides, vegetable-based cutting fluids are invariably a major source of food insecurity of edible oils which is traditionally used as a staple food in many countries. Thus, the primary objective of this study is to experimentally investigate the effects of water-soluble sago starch-based cutting fluid on surface roughness and tool's flank wear using response surface methodology (RSM) while machining of 316 stainless steel. In order to observe the comparison, the experiments with same machining parameters are conducted with conventional cutting fluid. The prepared water-soluble sago starch based cutting fluid showed excellent cooling and lubricating performance. Therefore, in comparison to the machining using conventional cutting fluid, a decrease of 48.23% in surface roughness and 38.41% in flank wear were noted using presented approach. Furthermore, using the extreme learning machine (ELM), the obtained data is modeled to predict surface roughness and flank wear and showed good agreement between observations and predictions.

AB  - The Yangtze River Valley (YRV) experienced record-breaking extreme high temperature and weakened rainfall events in August 2022, which resulted in severe disasters and large socioeconomic losses. The importance of the intensification and westward movement of the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) with abnormal subsidence has been emphasized in previous studies. However, the source of the abnormal subsidence remains unknown. This study investigates the source of the abnormal subsidence over the YRV and discusses its possible causes by adopting the three-pattern decomposition of the atmospheric circulation (3P-DGAC). Meridional circulation (MC) was the main contributor to the abnormal vertical velocity (114%), while the contribution of zonal circulation (ZC) was negative (-14%). Additionally, the negative rainfall anomaly over the YRV can be explained mainly by the MC. The anomalous MC was characterized as a 'negative-positive-negative-positive-negative' quintuple distribution with sinking motion over the YRV. Anomalous MC is closely related to the sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) over the three oceans. The negative phase of the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) and La Nina SSTA leads to an anomalous rising motion of the ZC over the Maritime Continent, favoring the existence of the rising motion of the MC by the coupling effect. The positive phase of the North Atlantic triple (NAT) SSTA results in an anomalous Rossby wave train, which further leads to a sinking motion over the YRV.

AB  - Historical and future projected changes in climatic patterns over the largest irrigated basin in the world, the Indus River Basin (IRB), threaten agricultural production and food security in Pakistan, in particular for vulnerable farming communities. To build a more detailed understanding of the impacts of climate change on agriculture s in the IRB, the present study analyzes (1) observed trends in average temperature, precipitation and related extreme indicators, as well as seasonal shifts over a recent historical period (1997-2016); and (2) statistically downscaled future projections (up to 2100) from a set of climate models in conjunction with crop-specific information for the four main crops of the IRB: wheat, cotton, rice and sugarcane. Key findings show an increasing trend of about over 0.1 degrees C/year in observed minimum temperature across the study area over the historical period, but no significant trend in maximum temperature. Historical precipitation shows a positive annual increase driven mainly by changes in August and September. Future projections highlight continued warming resulting in critical heat thresholds for the four crops analyzed being increasingly exceeded into the future, in particular in the Kharif season. Concurrently, inter-annual rainfall variability is projected to increase up to 10-20% by the end of the 21st century, augmenting uncertainty of water availability in the basin. These findings provide insight into the nature of recent climatic shifts in the IRB and emphasize the importance of using climate impact assessments to develop targeted investments and efficient adaptation measures to ensure resilience of agriculture in Pakistan into the future.

AB  - The responses of tropical forests to environmental change are critical uncertainties in predicting the future impacts of climate change. The positive phase of the 2015-2016 El Nino Southern Oscillation resulted in unprecedented heat and low precipitation in the tropics with substantial impacts on the global carbon cycle. The role of African tropical forests is uncertain as their responses to short-term drought and temperature anomalies have yet to be determined using on-the-ground measurements. African tropical forests may be particularly sensitive because they exist in relatively dry conditions compared with Amazonian or Asian forests, or they may be more resistant because of an abundance of drought-adapted species. Here, we report responses of structurally intact old-growth lowland tropical forests inventoried within the African Tropical Rainforest Observatory Network (AfriTRON). We use 100 long-term inventory plots from six countries each measured at least twice prior to and once following the 2015-2016 El Nino event. These plots experienced the highest temperatures and driest conditions on record. The record temperature did not significantly reduce carbon gains from tree growth or significantly increase carbon losses from tree mortality, but the record drought did significantly decrease net carbon uptake. Overall, the long-term biomass increase of these forests was reduced due to the El Nino event, but these plots remained a live biomass carbon sink (0.51 +/- 0.40 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1)) despite extreme environmental conditions. Our analyses, while limited to African tropical forests, suggest they may be more resistant to climatic extremes than Amazonian and Asian forests.

AB  - Severe and extreme drought in southeastern mainland Asia (SEMA) worsened drastically in 2010-19, occurring more than twice as frequently as in the preceding decade. It is found that the spring rainfall has undergone a concordant positive-to-negative transition with the turning point at 2010, and can explain 43% of the overall regime shift toward exaggerated severely dry condition. Associated with the decadal precipitation change, the anomalous northeasterlies prevail over SEMA, resulting in weakened eastward moisture propagation from the Indian Ocean as well as enhanced divergence. Meanwhile, there is downward motion over SEMA. This circulation pattern is remotely forced by a teleconnection from the tropical western Indian Ocean (TWI) SST. TWI SST is negatively correlated with SEMA precipitation and highlights a regime shift around 2010, after which the TWI has persistent warm SST helping to maintain deficient SEMA precipitation. In terms of the physical mechanism, the heating in the TWI warms the troposphere aloft and emanates wedge-shaped Kelvin waves with their northeast flank traversing SEMA, where friction-driven northeasterly lowlevel wind and divergence emerge to block moisture penetration from the Indian Ocean. The low-level divergence is followed by descending motion in SEMA, suppressing convection and rainfall. Further, the simulated structure forced by TWI SST alone bears a close resemblance to the observed evidence, confirming the critical role of the TWI. Finally, it is shown that ENSO and its diversity have a modulating effect on SEMA precipitation as well as on the coupling between TWI SST and SEMA precipitation, during both the previous winter and the concurrent spring.

AB  - Species that inhabit high-shore environments on rocky shores survive prolonged periods of emersion and thermal stress. Using two Hong Kong high-shore littorinids (Echinolittorina malaccana and E. radiata) as models, we examined their behavioral repertoire to survive these variable and extreme conditions. Environmental temperatures ranged from 4 degrees C in the cool season to 55.5 degrees C in the hot season, with strong seasonal and daily fluctuations. In the hot season, both species allocated >35% of their activity budgets to stress-mitigating thermoregulatory behaviors (e.g. standing, towering) and relatively small proportions to foraging (<20%) and reproduction (<10%). In the assumedly benign cool season, greater proportions (>70%) of activity budgets were allocated to stress mitigation behaviors (crevice occupation, aggregation formation). Both species exhibited multifunctional behaviors that optimized time use during their tidally-constrained activity window in the hot season. Females mated while foraging when awash by the rising tide, and some males crawled on top of females prior to ceasing movement to form 'towers', which have both thermoregulatory benefits and reduce searching time for mates during subsequent activity. The function of such behaviors varies in a state-dependent manner, for example, the function of trail following changes over an activity cycle from mate searching on rising tides, to stress mitigation on falling tides (aiding aggregation formation), and to both functions through tower formation just before movement stops. Many of these behavioral responses are, therefore, multifunctional and can vary according to local conditions, allowing snails in this family to successfully colonize the extreme high-shore environment.

AB  - The aerospace metal cutting industry's search for environmentally friendly practices that do not compromise machining performance is well known. One of the major objectives is the reduction in use of cutting fluids, which play a major role in containing the harsh effects of severe heat generated during machining. Machining performance and product quality can be improved by controlling heat during machining. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of various environmentally friendly metalworking fluid (MF) strategies for the sustainable turning of aerospace aluminum alloy (Al-5.6Zn-2.5Mg-1.6Cu-0.23Cr-T6) for automotive, marine, and aerospace industrial applications. The SEM images were analyzed for worn tool surfaces and machined surfaces. Under dry conditions, heat does not dissipate well, and will enter the workpiece due to the absence of coolant. This causes extreme damage beneath a turned workpiece. Thus, at 10 mu m, a drop in microhardness of approximately 20% can be observed. A similar observation was made in a Ranque-Hilsch vortex tube (RHVT) and in compressed air; however, the drop in hardness was relatively low compared to dry conditions. This evaluation of microhardness indicated a heat-based attention in the turned workpiece, and thus, the heat-based effect was found to be lowest in RHVT and compressed air compared to dry conditions. Results showed that RHVT reduces temperature up to 10%, surface roughness 13%, and tool wear 20% compared to dry turning. Overall, RHVT was identified as more effective environmentally friendly cooling strategy than dry and compressed air for the turning of aluminum alloy 7075-T6.

AB  - One of the major obstacles along the way of electric vehicles' (EVs') wider global adoption is their limited driving range. Extreme cold or hot environments can further impact the EV's range as a significant amount of energy is needed for cabin and battery temperature regulation while the battery's power and energy capacity are also impeded. To overcome this issue, we present an optimal control strategy based on nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) for integrated thermal management (ITM) of the battery and cabin of EVs, where the proposed NMPC simultaneously optimizes the EV range and cabin comfort in real time. Firstly, the components of the designed ITM system are introduced and control-oriented modeling is done. Secondly, to demonstrate and validate the benefits of the proposed ITM, an optimal control problem is defined and dynamic programming (DP) is employed to find the global optimal solution. Thirdly, for practical implementation, NMPC-based control strategy is developed, where the cost function design and weights calibration are done in comparison with DP global optimal solution. Weight-tuning results show that our NMPC-based approach can achieve close driving range maximization as compared to the DP benchmark while ensuring cabin comfort. The developed NMPC-based ITM strategy is further illustrated by comparing its performance to two additional benchmark strategies, i.e., rule-based control and cabin heating only. Finally, our simulation results also identify several important factors that impact the benefits of the proposed NMPC-based ITM, which are used to summarize the operating conditions under which the proposed ITM is critically needed.

AB  - This study determined the effect of water bath cooking (70 & DEG;C and 90 & DEG;C for 40 min) and the extreme heat treatment by an autoclave (121 & DEG;C for 40 min) on the quality of breast meat of a fast-growing chicken, commercial broiler (CB), and slow-growing chickens, Korat chicken (KC), and Thai native chicken (NC) (Leung Hang Khao), by vibrational spectroscopic techniques, including synchrotron radia-tion-based Fourier transform infrared (SR-FTIR) microspectroscopy and Fourier transform Raman (FT-Raman) spectroscopy. Taste-enhancing com-pounds, including inosine-5'-monophosphate (IMP) and guanosine-5'-monophosphate (GMP), were better retained in cooked KC and NC meats than in cooked CB meat (P < 0.05). The high heat treatment at 121 & DEG; C depleted the amount of insoluble collagen in all breeds (P < 0.05). Shear force values of slow-growing chicken meat were not affected by high heating temperatures (P > 0.05). In addition, the high heat treatment increased protein carbonyl (P < 0.05), while no effect on in vitro protein digestibility (P > 0.05). SR-FTIR microspectroscopy performed better in differentiating the meat quality of different chicken breeds, whereas FT-Raman spectroscopy clearly revealed differences in meat qualities induced by heat-ing temperature. Based on principal component analy-sis (PCA), distinct characteristics of chicken meat cooked at 70 & DEG;C were high water-holding capacity, lightness (L*), moisture content, and predominant a-helix structure, correlating with Raman spectra at 3,217 cm-1 (O-H stretching of water) and 1,651 cm-1 (amide I; a-helix). The high heating temperature at 90 & DEG;C and 121 & DEG;C exposed protein structure to a greater extent, as evidenced by an increase in b-sheets, which was well correlated with the Raman spectra at 2,968 and 2,893 cm-1 (C-H stretching), tryptophan (880 cm-1), tyrosine (858 cm-1), and 1,042, 1,020, and 990 cm-1 (C-C stretching; b-sheet). SR-FTIR and FT -Raman spectroscopy show potential for differentiation of chicken meat quality with respect to breeds and cooking temperatures. The marked differences in wavenumbers would be beneficial as markers for deter-mining the quality of cooked meats from slow-and fast-growing chickens

AB  - Reef-building corals are at risk of extinction from ocean warming. While some corals can enhance their thermal limits by associating with dinoflagellate photosymbionts of superior stress tolerance, the extent to which symbiont communities will reorganize under increased warming pressure remains unclear. Here we show that corals in the hottest reefs in the world in the Persian Gulf maintain associations with the same symbionts across 1.5 years despite extreme seasonal warming and acute heat stress (>= 35 degrees C). Persian Gulf corals predominantly associated with Cladocopium (clade C) and most also hosted Symbiodinium (clade A) and/or Durusdinium (clade D). This is in contrast to the neighbouring and milder Oman Sea, where corals associated with Durusdinium and only a minority hosted background levels of Cladocopium. During acute heat stress, the higher prevalence of Symbiodinium and Durusdinium in bleached versus nonbleached Persian Gulf corals indicates that genotypes of these background genera did not confer bleaching resistance. Within symbiont genera, the majority of ITS2 rDNA type profiles were unique to their respective coral species, confirming the existence of host-specific symbiont lineages. Notably, further differentiation among Persian Gulf sites demonstrates that symbiont populations are either isolated or specialized over tens to hundreds of kilometres. Thermal tolerance across coral species was associated with the prevalence of a single ITS2 intragenomic sequence variant (C3gulf), definitive of the Cladocopium thermophilum group. The abundance of C3gulf was highest in bleaching-resistant corals and at warmer sites, potentially indicating a specific symbiont genotype (or set of genotypes) that may play a role in thermal tolerance that warrants further investigation. Together, our findings indicate that co-evolution of host-Symbiodiniaceae partnerships favours fidelity rather than flexibility in extreme environments and under future warming.

AB  - The integration of solar-driven interfacial evaporation and electricity co-generation is considered a promising approach to simultaneously alleviate freshwater scarcity and the energy crisis. However, affected by intermittent solar irradiation/uncontrollable weather, the overall performance of solar-driven evaporation in the real world is greatly reduced. Herein, inspired by antifreeze proteins in beetles that survive in extreme climates, all-weather solar-driven interfacial evaporators with a sandwich structure are designed. The top and bottom layers composed of MnO2-modified cotton cloth are used for photothermal conversion and water transport, meanwhile, the middle layer made of a phase change microcapsule/hydrogel composite serves for heat storage and release. Under 1 kW m(-2) irradiation, the evaporator exhibits a high evaporation rate of 2.67 kg m(-2) h(-1) and an efficiency of 89.5%. In the dark, the heat released from the phase change layer supports an evaporation rate of 0.43 kg m(-2) h(-1), 3.6 times that of pure water. Additionally, assembled with a thermoelectric module, the hybrid device achieves a stable output electricity power of 0.42 W m(-2) under 1-sun illumination and a prolonged output for 30 min in the dark. This work provides a novel approach for full-time solar-powered steam-electricity co-generation and a proof of concept for biomimetic steam generation/heat management integration.

AB  - Temperate fruit trees require chilling for rest completion, followed by sufficient heat accumulation for onset of growth and bloom. The application of phenological models to predict bloom dates has been widely used in orchard management. Examples of such application include selecting adapted cultivars less prone to early bloom, predicting needs for frost protection, and preventing damage from late spring freezes. This study merged theUtah(chill) and ASYMCUR (forcing) phenological models by combining chill units and heat units (measured in growing degree hours) to predict bloom dates of tart cherries (Prunus cerasusL.) in Utah and Michigan, the top producing states of the USA. It was found that the modifiedUtahmodel improves the estimation of chill units compared with the original one, while the originalUtahmodel may still be suitable for use in the colder winter of Michigan (with its later bloom dates than Utah). The combined models were applied with the temperature predicted by the Climate Forecast System v2 (CFSv2) model. The prediction was applied twice a month, starting from 1 February to 1 May. TheUtah-ASYMCUR model using the forecasted temperature from CFSv2 exhibits subseasonal performance in predicting the bloom dates for 6 weeks in advance. The prediction can offer growers a way to mitigate extreme climate anomalies.

AB  - The most important characteristic of glass transition is a jump in the specific heat Delta C-p. Despite its significance, no standard theory exists to describe it. In this study, first-principles molecular-dynamics simulations are used to describe the glass transition of silica glass. The novel view that state variables are extended to include the equilibrium positions of atoms {R-j} is fully used in analyzing the simulation results. Decomposing the internal energy into three components (structural, phonon, and thermal expansion energies) reveals that the jump Delta C-p of silica glass is entirely determined by the component of structural energy. The reason for the small Delta C-p is its high glass-transition temperature, which makes the fluctuation in the structural energy insensitive to the temperature change. This significantly affects how the Prigogine-Defay ratio. is interpreted, which was previously unknown. The ratio Pi represents the ratio of the total energy change to the contribution of thermal expansion energy at the glass transition. The general property,Pi.> 1, of glasses indicates that glass transitions occur mainly via the change in the structural energy. Silica glass is an extreme case in that the transition occurs entirely through the change in internal structure, such as the distribution of the bending angle of Si-O-Si bonds.

AB  - This paper evaluates the energy poverty of Vietnam by mediating the role of financial development and environmental considerations. Across the globe, billions of individuals live in fuel poverty, failing to access inexpensive and sustainable energy, which is necessary for long-term development. An elevation in power consumption due to an overall increase in heat and short periods of extreme heat exacerbates global warming. The goal of this research is to look at how climate change is affecting energy poverty in Vietnam. This finding (1) demonstrates that temperature shocks have a positive and quantitative impact. (2) The same may be said for "poor income/high cost" figures, which include information on power rates. Similarly, if households use the same amount of power but spend less on other items, the influence will not raise their electricity use. (3) Thermal shocks have been shown to reduce agricultural output in studies. During seasons of low rainfall, for example, higher evaporation and plant water demand can worsen drought and raise total irrigation expenses. Labor productivity is also affected by rising temperatures, particularly in weather-sensitive industries like agriculture. As a result, heat shocks will lower agricultural revenues, worsening energy poverty. Surprisingly, overall income appears to be a little mitigating influence. This might be owing to widespread underreporting of stated income, particularly among persons who rely on agriculture for their livelihood.

AB  - Worldwide environmental degradation and climate change are foremost concerning factors where anthropogenic activities and extreme natural disasters affect urban areas. Thermal variation, greenery damage, built-up expansion, and transportation accessibility destroy healthy atmosphere. Maintaining climate change scenarios is dynamic characteristic to protect the earth's biodiversity, else, global climate change is destroying natural barriers to protecting earth's surface. Space-based remote sensing satellite imageries (Landsat TM and OLI/TIRS) were used to explain surface urban heat island (SUHI) effects besides Land use and land cover (LULC) alteration from 1991 to 2021. Six types of LULC classes are identified in Mosul metropolis where built-up lands are expended around 120.82 km(2) (1991-2021). Agricultural land (29.69km(2)) and vegetation (5.67km(2)) are increasing because of anthropogenic activities. Barren land was decreased during study periods due to built-up expansion and vegetation growth. Throughout study periods, temperature increased by 9.82 degrees C while the annual temperature increased by 0.33 degrees C in Mosul metropolis (Albu Sayf, Al Jazar, Arubah, and Gogjali). The SUHI is also located in increasing scenarios like 1.95 while annual SUHI increased by 0.065. Iraq is affected by several climatic and anthropogenic activities related to scenarios where built-up lands are gradually bigger in Mosul Metropolis due to population pressure.

AB  - With the development of 5G equipment, aerospace, sensors, thermal management devices and other fields in the direction of high power, high performance and miniaturization, the heat released during usage increases significantly, leaving great application prospects for heat dissipation materials. In spite of great attention paid to film materials due to their light weight and flexibility, they have the obvious disadvantage of poor thermal conductivity. In this work, carboxylated cellulose (CNF-C)/dopamine-coated nickel-coated graphene (PDA-Ni@GNS) composite films with high in-plane thermal conductivity (in-plane TC) have been fabricated by a simple vacuum-assisted filtration method. In the prepared composite films, the flaky packing layers were found to be stacked orderly and form an excellent thermally conductive network, resulting in an increase in in-plane TC by 322.1% (sample W4) as compared with that of neat films. By comparing the in-plane TCs of the composite films with that of a commercial gasket, it was readily seen that the present composite films had fairly excellent heat dissipation properties. The composite exhibits not only sufficiently high in-plane TC and tensile strength of 149.02 MPa but also exhibits hydrophobic property, imparting the composite films good working stability under extreme conditions, which ensured of their potential applications in thermal management materials.

AB  - The long-standing performance-stability contradiction issue of high energy density materials (HEDMs) is of extremely complex and multi-parameter nature. Herein, machine learning was employed to handle 28 feature descriptors and 5 properties of detonation and stability of 153 HEDMs, wherein all 21,648 data used were obtained through high-throughput crystal-level quantum mechanics calculations on supercomputers. Among five models, namely, extreme gradient boosting regression tree (XGBoost), adaptive boosting, random forest, multi-layer perceptron, and kernel ridge regression, were respectively trained and evaluated by stratified sampling and 5-fold cross-validation method. Among them, XGBoost model produced the best scoring metrics in predicting the detonation velocity, detonation pressure, heat of explosion, decomposition temperature, and lattice energy of HEDMs, and XGBoost predictions agreed best with the 1,383 experimental data collected from massive literatures. Feature importance analysis was conducted to obtain data-driven insight into the causality of the performance-stability contradiction and delivered the optimal range of key features for more efficient rational design of advanced HEDMs.

AB  - The synthesis of a polymer that combines the processability of plastics with the extreme rigidity of cross-linked organic networks is highly attractive for molecular sieving applications. However, cross-linked networks are typically insoluble or infusible, preventing them from being processed as plastics. Here, we report a solution-processable conjugated microporous thermoset with permanent pores of similar to 0.4nm, prepared by a simple heating process. When employed as a two-dimensional molecular sieving membrane for hydrogen separation, the membrane exhibits ultrahigh permeability with good selectivity for H-2 over CO2, O-2, N-2, CH4, C3H6 and C3H8. The combined processability, structural rigidity and easy feasibility make this polymeric membrane promising for large-scale hydrogen separations of commercial and environmental relevance.

AB  - Worldwide concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and energy-efficient applications. A new type of air con-dition system is proposed, which consists of waste heat-driven solution dehumidification and ejector refrigera-tion enhanced transcritical CO2 (tCO2) system. The characteristic of the system when applied to ocean-going vessels was examined. The load variation of the system was calculated under different indoor design condi-tions and outdoor environments. The operation and supercooling enhancement of tCO2 refrigeration in hot waters were investigated, the optimal discharge pressure of the tCO2 system is 9.2 MPa, and the corresponding maximum COP is 3.14, which is 8 % lower and 22.18 % higher than the base system respectively; finally, select the classic route to calculate the dynamic load and power consumption of the route, the average power con-sumption of the dynamic load calculation system is 36 kW, which is 26.5 % less than the power consumption of the system under the design parameters. The proposed system is suitable for complex and changeable offshore operating conditions, realizes the university application of tCO2 systems in the shipping industry, and the calculation method of dynamic load is to reduce navigation energy consumption and meet the thermal comfort of local extreme environments.

AB  - The present study examines the temporal and spatial variability of near-surface air temperature and the canopy layer urban heat island (UHI) in Singapore. Observations collected at 20 locations across the island city-state and during 6 years make this one of the most extensive studies carried out in a tropical city. Local climate zones (LCZs), defined as urban built and rural land cover types which produce a unique air temperature response, are used to standardize intersite comparison. The results show that the choice of the rural reference can affect the night-time UHI magnitude by up to 2 degrees C under "ideal" (dry, clear, calm) conditions. The most frequently observed median UHI magnitude increases from 2.8 during all-weather to 3.7 degrees C during "ideal" conditions, respectively. A seasonality is present with lowest (highest) mean all-weather values of similar to 2.0 degrees C (similar to 3.3 degrees C), observed during the wet (dry) December-January (April-October) period. Mean night-time UHI intensity across seven built-type LCZs ranges between 1.8 and 3.5 degrees C (2.5 and 4.3 degrees C) for all-weather ("ideal") conditions. Corresponding daily values are 1.1-2.3 degrees C (1.5-2.7 degrees C). The lowest (highest) night-time magnitudes are associated with open low-rise LCZ 6 (compact high-rise LCZ 1) built type. In the middle of the day LCZ 1 can experience a cool island effect. The average UHI values presented here give an indication of the extra warmth experienced in the built-up spaces of Singapore relative to one possible rural reference land cover type (scattered trees LCZ B). Highest daytime heat exposure is observed in LCZs 3 and 8 which are characterized by low building heights, high impervious surface fraction and lack of vegetation. The present results can be used to support the development and evaluation of urban climate models, develop urban planning policies and improve local weather forecasts and the delivery of integrated urban services.

AB  - Urban composition has exacerbated precipitation patterns. Rapid urbanization with dynamic composition and anthropogenic activities lead to the change of physical environment, especially land-use and land cover which subsequently magnifies the environmental effects such as flash floods, extreme lightning, and landslides. Due to extreme and elevated temperature trends with exacerbated rainfall patterns, these environmental effects become major issues in tropics. Albeit several studies pointed out that rapid urbanization induced precipitation, studies about the heterogeneity of urban composition on precipitation variables are still limited. Thus, this paper review studies about precipitation pattern in relation to the heterogeneity of urban composition that successfully integrates geographical information system (GIS) and remote sensing techniques to enhance the understanding of interactions between precipitation patterns against heterogeneity of urban composition. This article also addressed the current state of uncertainties and scarcity of data concerning remote sensing techniques. Evidently, with a comprehensive investigation and probing of the precipitation variables in the context of urbanization models fused with remote sensing and GIS, they put forward powerful set tools for geographic cognition and understand how its influence on spatial variation. Hence, this study indicated a great research opportunity to set the course of action in determining the magnitude of spatial heterogeneity of an urban composition towards the pattern of precipitation.

AB  - Urban heat island (UHI) is a typical urban thermal pollution which occurs due to the development of higher ambient air temperatures in densely built cities that deteriorate the air quality of urban area due to anthropogenic activities. The aforementioned urban complexity results in the absorption and retention of heat which is re-emitted after sunset, creating a steep temperature gradient between urban and rural areas. The effect of UHI on public health is reduced outdoor thermal comfort levels of city dwellers in various urban settings. In this study, UHI, air quality and thermal comfort are discussed as climate-related disasters on public health in Malaysia. Understanding of UHI Intensity (UHII) using meteorological network's observations and mobile weather trackers in the urban and suburban areas of Malaysia will explore the hotspot and green lung of each climate zone for implementing a necessary approach to minimize the human exposure to extreme heat and contaminated air. Incorporation of more explanatory variables of UHI from both meteorological and urban factors is a requisite to identify their pivotal association with UHI intensification in the Malaysian context. In spite of the fact that seasonal haze episodes and UHI have become a recurrent seasonal phenomenon in Malaysia, the number of public health studies is still scarce in this region. More intensive studies are still needed to establish veritable evidence for the susceptible populations to devise effective health planning to reduce haze and UHI-associated health impacts in Malaysia. With such acquired knowledge of the UHI and air quality issues and related underlying mechanisms, urban planners, designers and decision-makers can perform more evidence-based decision-making to create, reform or rejuvenate climate-friendly sustainable cities for enhanced liveability in future. Furthermore, such scientific knowledge will become a valuable input and tool for the policy-makers to identify the right policy choices aimed at sustainable healthcare solutions.

AB  - The short-term concurrent hot and dry extreme (SCHDE) event has recently stimulated intensive scientific interests due to its rapid onset, severe intensity, and devastating impacts on agriculture and natural ecosystems. The SCHDE is mainly caused by an increase in actual evapotranspiration (ET) accompanied with a decrease in soil moisture (SM) due to anomalously high surface temperature (T (air)). Based on the daily datasets of precipitation (P), T (air), ET, and SM from four global modelling products as well as large-scale climate indices, we analyse globally the spatio-temporal evolution of SCHDE events at both grid and basin scales. Results indicate that SCHDE events occur mostly in Northern Hemisphere regions with relatively low P. During 1980-2010, due to significant global warming (0.30 degrees C center dot decade(-1)) the global mean occurrence frequency of SCHDE has an significantly increasing trend (0.34%center dot decade(-1)) along with a weakly decreasing trend of SM (-0.08%center dot decade(-1)) and a significantly increasing trend of ET (8.34 mm center dot decade(-1)). Overall, North America and Asia have a higher frequency of SCHDE occurrence than other continents. The variability of T (air) is mainly responsible for the variability of SCHDE occurrence over the equator regions, while the variability of ET (SM) plays an important role in SCHDE occurrence variability in the cropland-dominant (mid- and high-latitude) regions. Globally, the relative contribution of T (air) to SCHDE variability is the largest, followed by ET and SM. Lastly, we found that the cold phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation during the La Nina events (i.e., negative Multivariate ENSO Index) are conducive to the intensification of SCHDE events in southern South America and Australia.

AB  - Temperature shock is a major natural cause of mass mortality of global fish. Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus, one of the most widely cultured species, with high resistance against severe environmental conditions, is also affected by rapid temperature changes. This research was conducted to investigate histopathological changes and oxidative stress in O. niloticus in response to temperature shock. The malondialdehyde levels in the serum, gills and brain, the histopathology of the gills and brain, and the histochemical characterization of the gills' mucosubstances were measured in the fish exposed to heat shock and cold shock conditions. The results showed that the fish could not survive under 37 degrees C for 24 hours. Malondialdehyde levels in the gills, brain and serum increased significantly when compared to those of the controls. Moreover, histopathological changes and a decrease in the number of neutral and acidic mucous cells was observed in the gills of fish in both the heat shock and cold shock groups. Histopathological alteration, vacuolated neuropil in the brain, was observed only in the fish in the cold shock groups. The results from this study indicate that rapid 4 degrees C changes in water temperature (25-21 and 25-29 degrees C) evoked oxidative stress and histological damage to O. niloticus, whereas extreme 12 degrees C changes (25-13 and 25-37 degrees C) severely affected their oxidative stress and histopathological condition.

AB  - When assessing the state of the climate system, industrial area heat (IAH) is one of the most critical variables for energy auditing. Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing techniques were used to track the surface temperature and microclimate impacts in an industrial environment by analysing in-situ data and their relationship with industrial features to characterise their impacts on human health and climate change. Based on TIR data, this study used an automatic detection method for industrial area heat (IAH). The IAH data is first retrieved, then the local abnormal high-temperature pixels are extracted using PIX4D software for UAV and split window for Landsat 8, and finally, the hotspot targets are identified using the spatial autocorrelation Moran's analysis tool available in the ArcGIS ESRI environment. The correlations (R2) between in-situ measurement and satellite-based industrial emissions at PGI were 0.85 with an RMSE of + 3.37 and 0.89 with an RMSE of + 1.42 at KSM. The detection accuracy of IAH methods is dominant. IAH accounted for 20% of the cool- and hot spots areas in the entire study area. The total cool-spots had a higher polygons per km2 (3.5 n/km2) value than the total hot-spots (0.6 n/km2) value, while LEVEL-3 and LEVEL-2 had the lowest values, while the highest values were always found in LEVEL-1, with approximately 50 % IAH variation between the previous and next level. Moving from the total average cool-spot to the total average hot-spot classes generally increased about 5 degrees C. Between the most extreme cool- and hot-spot levels (LEVEL-3) for PG in the overall industrial area, a mean IAH increase of approximately 34.7 degrees C and 58.5 degrees C was observed.

AB  - As the depth of underground resource extraction continues to extend, the operating conditions in deep mines are becoming increasingly harsh, and high temperatures and humidity are now posing a huge threat to the health of workers and mine safety production. In an attempt to assist mine management in assessing the riskiness of the extreme hot and humid environment of underground mining, we proposed a multi-indicator grading model. The model was developed around eight factors that affect high heat and humidity environments, using the uncertainty measurement theory. In the evaluation process, the indicator weights were determined by the entropy weighting method, and then the multi-indicator measure evaluation matrix was derived. The confidence recognition criterion was used to determine the grade, so as to obtain the evaluation results of thermal humidity risk. A ranking of the riskiness importance of the evaluation objects was also achieved. Finally, the model was used to analyse and assess the risk rating of thermal humidity at 11 working faces in a gold mine. The results show that the evaluation results are consistent with the real results and this approach can be applied in practical engineering.

AB  - The rocks in the studied area are prone to deterioration and failure due to frequent exposure to extreme temperature variations and loading conditions. In the context of rock engineering reliability assessment, understanding the energy conversion process in rocks is critical. Therefore, this research work aims to assess the energy characteristics and failure modes of pink and white-black granite subjected to uniaxial compression loading at various temperatures. Samples of pink and white-black granite are heated to a range of temperatures (0 & DEG;C, 200 & DEG;C, 400 & DEG;C, 600 & DEG;C, 900 & DEG;C, and 1100 & DEG;C), and their failure modes and energy characteristics including total energy, elastic energy, and dissipated energy are studied by testing preheated samples under uniaxial compression. The results show that the dissipation energy coefficient initially rises rapidly, and then falls back to its minimum value at the failure stage. The microstructures of granite rock directly affect its elastic and dissipation energy. Axial splitting failure mode is observed in most of the damaged granite specimens. After heating granite to 600 & DEG;C, the effect of temperature on the failure mode becomes apparent.

AB  - Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were employed asadded particlesfor nanofluids in this practical investigation. To identify the mostappropriate nanofluid for cooling PVT systems that are functionalin the extreme summer environment of Baghdad, the parameters of basefluid, surfactant, and sonication time used for mixing were examined.Water was chosen as the base fluid instead of other potential candidatessuch as ethylene glycol (EG), propylene glycol (PG), and heat transferoil (HTO). Thermal conductivity and stability were important thermophysicalqualities that were impacted by the chosen parameters. The nanofluidtested in Baghdad city (consisting of 0.5% MWCNTs, water, and CTABwith a sonication period of three and a quarter hours) resulted ina 119.5, 308, and 210% enhancement of thermal conductivity (TC) forwater compared with EG, PG, and oil, respectively. In addition, thenanofluid-cooled PVT system had an electrical efficiency that was88.85% higher than standalone PV technology and 44% higher than water-cooledPVT systems. Moreover, the thermal efficiency of the nanofluid-cooledPVT system was 20% higher than the water-cooled PVT system. Finally,the nanofluid-cooled PVT system displayed the least decrease in electricalefficiency and a greater thermal efficiency even when the PV panelwas at its hottest at noon.

AB  - Designing cities for thermal comfort is an important priority in a warming and urbanizing world. As temperatures in cities continue to break extreme heat records, it is necessary to develop and test new approaches capable of tracking human thermal sensations influenced by microclimate conditions, complex urban geometries, and individual charac-teristics in dynamic settings. Thermal walks are a promising novel research method to address this gap. During a ther-mal walk in Phoenix, Arizona, USA, we examined relationships between the built environment, microclimate, and subjective thermal judgments across a downtown city neighborhood slated for redevelopment. Subjects equipped with GPS devices participated in a 1-hour walk on a hot sunny day and recorded their experience in a field guide. Mi-croclimate measurements were simultaneously collected using the mobile human-biometeorological instrument plat-form MaRTy. Results revealed significant differences in physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) and modified physiologically equivalent temperature (mPET) and between street segments with more than 18 degrees C (25 degrees C mPET) be-tween the maximum and minimum values. Wider range of mPET values reflected the inclusion of individual level data into the model. Streets with higher sky view factor (SVF) and east-west orientation showed a higher PET and mPET overall. Furthermore, we showed evidence of thermal alliesthesia, the pleasure resulting from slight changes in micro -climate conditions. Participants' sense of pleasure was related to the mean PET of the segment they just walked, with linear regression explaining over 60% of the variability. We also showed that estimated percent shade was significantly correlated with SVF, PET, mPET, and pleasure, indicating that participants could sense minor changes in microclimate and perceived shade as pleasant. Although generalization of results is limited by a low sample size, findings of this study improve the understanding of dynamic thermal comfort in complex urban environments and highlight the value of thermal walks as a robust research method.

AB  - The high-pressure melting diagram of iron is a vital ingredient for the geodynamic modeling of planetary interiors. Nonetheless, available data for molten iron show an alarming discrepancy. Herein, we propose an efficient one-phase approach to capture the solid-liquid transition of iron under extreme conditions. Our basic idea is to extend the statistical moment method to determine the density of iron in the TPa region. On that basis, we adapt the work-heat equivalence principle to appropriately link equation-of-state parameters with melting properties. This strategy allows explaining cutting-edge experimental and ab initio results without massive computational workloads. Our theoretical calculations would be helpful to constrain the chemical composition, internal dynamics, and thermal evolution of the Earth and super-Earths.

AB  - Environmental condition varies considerably in intertidal habitat, exposing photosynthetic organisms to diverse stressors, including heat stress and excess light. Herein, we examined the interactive effects of temperature and irradiance on photosynthesis, calcification and oxidative stress in Halimeda macroloba, Halimeda opuntia and Padina boryana, three common calcifying macroalgae in shallow reef flats in Thailand. Six treatments lasting 3 h were established under different temperatures (32, 37, 42 degrees C) and irradiance (150 and 1000 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)). Net photosynthetic carbon uptake and calcification rates were estimated from changes in pH and total alkalinity, while the quantum yields were assessed using the chlorophyll fluorescence technique. Total reactive oxygen species, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, guaiacol peroxidase (GPOX) activity, and total glutathione content were measured at the end of the experiment. Our results show that the stress responses were primarily induced by high temperature, observed as lowered photosynthetic carbon uptake rates, photoinhibition (measured as a decrease in F-v/F-m and rETR(max)) and lowered calcification rates in all three macroalgae. The most severe effects were observed at 42 degrees C. This extreme temperature also led to the dissolution of calcium carbonate and a reduction in antioxidant capacity (SOD in H. macroloba, and H. opuntia and GPOX in P. boryana). Our findings suggest that a temperature rise is a potential threat to the health of calcified macroalgae. Nevertheless, H. macroloba and H. opuntia may be more sensitive to heat stress than P. boryana, which maintained positive net photosynthetic carbon uptake and calcification rates and higher maximum quantum yield at 42 degrees C.

AB  - The battery thermal management system (BTMS) of a lithium-ion battery aims to prevent accelerated battery aging at elevated temperatures and reduced operability at low temperatures. Cooling or heating the battery prevents it from being operated outside the preferred temperature window but increases energy consumption, increases maintenance costs and requires an additional investment. Therefore, for a given use case, battery designers need to decide whether installing a heating system is required, if it is cost effective to install a cooling system, and how the battery should be thermally connected to the ambient air. This study presents a method for the techno-economic assessment of different BTMS. The method is applied to stationary energy storage (SES) supporting a fast charging station. This use case was chosen because these batteries are located outdoors and their heat transfer to the surrounding air can be increased or reduced without being limited by packaging constraints. The method is demonstrated by evaluating the cost of five different BTMS in the tropical climate of Singapore and the continental climate of Munich, Germany. The results show that the cost-effectiveness of different BTMS depends on the climate in which the battery is operated. For the Munich climate, the passively cooled baseline design results in the lowest cost, whereas in the Singapore climate the lowest cost is achieved by equipping the SES with cooling fins. Installing active cooling is not cost-effective in both climates for the given use case, but might be considered for ecological considerations, warranty requirements, or to allow safe operation in unexpected extreme conditions. The method enables thermal system designers to evaluate the cost effectiveness of different BTMS in different climate conditions during the early-stage design phase.

AB  - Relatively, little is known about the corpus luteum (CL) function in early pregnancy after the successful treatment of luteal phase deficiency in repeat-breeder dairy cows when exposed to extreme environments under tropical climate. To investigate the influence of increased tissues of corpora lutea (CLs) by inducing secondary CL based on progesterone (P4) concentration and fertility in repeat-breeder dairy cows undergoing the fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI) protocol, 32 cows were treated with gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) on day 5 post-induction (experiment 1). In experiment 2, 213 cows were bred using the short-term FTAI protocol. On day 5 post-FTAI, cows were divided into two groups: treatment with (GnRHS-treated group) or without (GnRHS-untreated group) GnRH. The temperature-humidity index ranged from 77.3 to 82.8. Cows bearing two CLs had greater P4 concentrations than cows bearing only one CL on their ovaries (P < 0.05). Pregnancy rates were greater in GnRHS-treated group than the GnRHS-untreated group (P < 0.01). Moreover, repeat-breeder cows bearing two CLs had a greater likelihood of pregnancy (odds ratio =20.86) than cows bearing only one CL on their ovaries (P < 0.01). Under heat stress condition, the results highlighted that increasing luteal tissues by creating secondary CL leads to enhanced peripheral P4 concentrations and improved pregnancy outcomes in repeat-breeder dairy cows.

AB  - Thermal stress is an important driver of species' distribution in the intertidal zone and, with the forecasted increasing frequency of extreme high temperatures associated with climate change, is likely to play an even greater role in the future. To better understand the scales at which thermal stress impacts organisms, we used biomimetic temperature loggers (robobarnacles) to measure latitudinal variation in estimated barnacle body temperatures (Tetraclita spp.) and evaluated the influences of large, geographic, and smaller scale, microhabitat variation on temperatures experienced. Robobarnacles were deployed at nine sites along the West Pacific and South China Sea coast (five sites in Taiwan, three in Hong Kong and one in Thailand, spanning 13-25 degrees N) from May to September 2013. Estimated body temperatures did not follow a latitudinal gradient; instead, they revealed a mosaic of hot (e.g., NE Taiwan and Thailand) and cooler sites (e.g., two sites in Hong Kong). The hot sites were characterized by frequent occurrences of "heat stress" events (estimated body temperatures 40 degrees C for >2 h which would result in >50% Tetraclita entering coma). There was a correlation between hourly air temperatures and robo-temperatures, suggesting that air temperature together with solar radiation and thermal radiation re-emitted by the rocky substrate drove the observed spatial robo-temperature variation. Air temperature mediated by solar radiation and rock thermal radiation are, therefore, important contributors affecting the body temperature of sessile intertidal species in the tropical and subtropical W Pacific and South China Sea and can be a good predictor for body temperature and thermal stress of intertidal barnacles.

AB  - The aim of this research is to study and evaluate the effects of cobalt and nickel additions on heat-treated and thermal-exposed microstructures in cast nickel-base superalloy grades based on GTD-111 with cobalt and nickel modifications. In the study, 1 wt.-% aluminium, as well as various cobalt and nickel contents, was added to all the modified alloy. After standard heat treatment, it was found that increasing the 1 wt.-% aluminium content affected the morphology of gamma prime particles, causing them to become more cuboidal in shape and larger in size. On the other hand, the size of gamma prime in all modified alloys decreased slightly with increasing cobalt contents. However, cobalt and nickel additions did not strongly affect the shape of the gamma prime particles. After long-term exposure at temperatures of 1173 K and 1273 K for 1440 ks, these gamma prime particles were much larger in size than those of heat-treated ones. The higher temperature caused extreme increases in the average size of thermal-exposed gamma prime particles. Also, the gamma prime particles became nearly spherical in shape and had lower coarsening rate with higher cobalt and lower nickel contents. Moreover, the addition of cobalt reduced the coalescence of gamma prime particles. Samples with cobalt content higher than 13.1 wt.-% were able to maintain the cubic shape of the particles even after long-term exposure at a temperature of 1273 K for 1440 ks. No topologically close-packed phase was found in any analyzed specimens.

AB  - Climate change has led to an increase in global air temperatures, posing a threat to the liability of capital cities. This study focuses on understanding the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) phenomena, which occurs over cities and is exacerbated by climate change. Spectral indices derived from Landsat data were used to understand SUHI, while trends in air temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity were analyzed using ground observation data collected from 1992 to 2022 in the capital city of Indonesia, Jakarta. The spectral indices used were the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI). Land Surface Temperature (LST) was used to represent SUHI. Results indicate that NDMI has the highest Pearson's correlation coefficient with LST (-0.73), followed by EVI (-0.41), SAVI (- 0.4), and NDVI (-0.4). Trend analysis using Mann-Kendal test and Sen's Slope showed a statistically significant increase in air temperature with a slope estimation of 0.03oC per year, while rainfall and relative humidity did not significantly differ over 30 years. SUHI trend analysis showed a statistically significant increase with a slope estimation of 0.1oC from 1992-2022. Mean surface temperature increased from 38.9oC in 1992 to 39.4oC in 2022. Jakarta's surface temperature ranged from 24 degrees C - 57 degrees C across water bodies, vegetation, bare land, urban, and industry, analyzed using Support Vector Machine. This study provides insight into the condition of SUHI over time, allowing the government to make efforts to mitigate the impact of climate change.

AB  - Urban coral reefs are regarded as marginal communities that live under localized conditions considered detrimental for coral survival, such as high sediment load. They are also impacted by global environmental changes, especially increases in sea surface temperatures. These conditions can cause sub-optimal performance and may lead to dissociation of the mutualistic symbiosis between the coral host and its endosymbionts (Symbiodiniaceae), which provide the majority of the coral's daily energy budget. While recent studies have explored gene transcriptional responses to extreme conditions using cultured cells of Symbiodiniaceae, it is generally unknown how their responses manifest in hospite. Here, we investigate differential gene expression of endosymbionts hosted by the common reef-building coral Pocillopora acuta, following separate and combined exposures to two major environmental stressors: heat and sediment. We report that Durusdinium largely dominate the Symbiodiniaceae population in P. acuta, which suggests that the observed differential gene expression patterns are mainly responses from this known stress-tolerant endosymbiont genus. Differentially expressed genes were detected in response to heat, and to combined heat and sediment. These genes are associated with various biological processes including apoptosis, cell proliferation, cell-extracellular matrix adhesion, DNA damage repair, lipid catabolism, and lipid homeostasis. Our study provides valuable insights regarding the role of gene regulation by the endosymbiotic dinoflagellates to help maintain health and function of the coral host, which ultimately contributes to the persistence of P. acuta in Singapore's highly urbanized reefs.

AB  - A multi-faceted vertical rib has been numerically investigated using the internal flow of rib in a rectangular channel method under turbulent flow for 17,000 < Re < 27,000. The vertical rib that can be encountered inside porous media design often creates a persisting issue of high-pressure drop. The challenge frequently intensifies, mainly when a two-phase state heat transfer is introduced inside the porous media. The vertical multi-faceted rib models the various surfaces often encountered inside the porous media. The effect of blockage ratio on the flow characteristics and thermal performance is observed. The results are compared to the more conventional circular rib, equal in surface area to the multi-faceted rib. The multi-faceted rib yields a higher average Nusselt number of approximately 33% and contributes to the higher average Nusselt number of the channel. The multi-faceted rib channel has a better thermal performance factor, in average of approximately 13% higher and lower pressure drop than the circular rib channel. The advantage of the multi-faceted rib is attributed to, surprisingly, the poor flow attachment on the rib surface, which results in a low C-f/f ratio. Consequently, the multi-faceted rib suffers from very low velocity on the downstream rib surface. Ultimately, the spatial effect of the rib inside the square channel can be evaluated using the C-f/f ratio, which takes into account the rib surface and channel walls. In the quasi two-phase state, the circular rib is observed to provide a more favorable condition for latent heat transfer under extreme condition investigated.

AB  - The last two decades have seen a dramatic decline and strong year-to-year variability in Arctic winter sea ice, especially in the Barents-Kara Sea (BKS), changes that have been linked to extreme midlatitude weather and climate. It has been suggested that these changes in winter sea ice arise largely from a combined effect of oceanic and atmospheric processes, but the relative importance of these processes is not well established. Here, we explore the role of atmospheric circulation patterns on BKS winter sea ice variability and trends using observations and climate model simulations. We find that BKS winter sea ice variability is primarily driven by a strong anticyclonic anomaly over the region, which explains more than 50% of the interannual variability in BKS sea-ice concentration (SIC). Recent intensification of the anticyclonic anomaly has warmed and moistened the lower atmosphere in the BKS by poleward transport of moist-static energy and local processes, resulting in an increase in downwelling longwave radiation. Our results demonstrate that the observed BKS winter sea-ice variability is primarily driven by atmospheric, rather than oceanic, processes and suggest a persistent role of atmospheric forcing in future Arctic winter sea ice loss.

AB  - Today, extreme weather conditions occur globally due to climate change, and roads with traditional impermeable pavement could cause environmental problems, such as urban flooding and heat islands. Although porous pavement is an important environmentally friendly alternative pavement structure for roads, it has many disadvantages and is not yet widely used. Therefore, this paper reported the use of stone columns in the soil subgrade of porous pavement to improve the performance of roads. Soil property tests were conducted to evaluate the permeability of subgrade soil in a field area at different depths. Stone columns with different heights and various aggregate sizes were installed in the soil subgrade in the laboratory and the field, with the concrete footing on top of the stone columns as the bedding course of the pavement. Quantitative comparisons of the permeability of stone columns in the laboratory and the field were undertaken. In addition, the temperature changes in the stone columns and concrete footings before and after watering were tested to investigate the influence of the stone columns on the thermal behavior of roads. The test results showed that stone columns improved the water drainage in porous pavement and contributed to temperature reductions in urban roads. Therefore, the use of stone columns is recommended in porous pavement to improve water drainage and mitigate urban heat islands.

AB  - Anticipatory changes in organismal responses, triggered by reliable environmental cues for future conditions, are key to species' persistence in temporally variable environments. Such responses were tested by measuring the physiological performance of a tropical high-shore oyster in tandem with the temporal predictability of environmental temperature. Heart rate of the oyster increased with environmental temperatures until body temperature reached similar to 37 degrees C, when a substantial depression occurred (similar to 60%) before recovery between similar to 42 degrees and 47 degrees C, after which cardiac function collapsed. The sequential increase, depression, and recovery in cardiac performance aligned with temporal patterns in rock surface temperatures, where the risk of reaching temperatures close to the oysters' lethal limit accelerates if the rock heats up beyond similar to 37 degrees C, coinciding closely with the body temperature at which the oysters initiate metabolic depression. The increase in body temperature over a critical threshold serves as an early-warning cue to initiate anticipatory shifts in physiology and energy conservation before severe thermal stress occurs on the shore. Cross-correlating the onset of physiological mechanisms and temporal structures in environmental temperatures, therefore, reveals the potential role of reliable real-time environmental cues for future conditions in driving the evolution of anticipatory responses.

AB  - The complicated pattern of the chaotic ocean surface depends strongly on the interaction between wind and waves. An accurate representation of momentum and energy exchange at air-sea interface is very important for ocean modeling and climate studies. The exchange of momentum, heat, and moisture at the air-sea interface considered a fundamental process in the development of mesoscale atmospheric phenomena such as hurricanes and precipitating systems. Since these exchanges take place in the wave boundary layer, one cannot neglect the importance of ocean surface waves in modifying air-sea interaction processes. In this paper, the sensitivity of a regional coupled atmosphere-wave model to sea surface roughness parameterizations is discussed. In order to see the impact of sea spray in modifying the surface gravity waves, we have introduced a sea-spray parameterization in surface layer scheme of the atmospheric model. We have taken the case of Hurricane Isaac, formed in the Gulf of Mexico in 2012 for this study. It is observed that the newly added sea-spray scheme shows a better performance compared with three existing, well-known formulations. Thus, during extreme events, sea spray can play an important role in modifying the wind and wave height.

AB  - Net zero requires an accelerated transition from fossil fuels to renewables. Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) can be an effective intermediate solution for the decarbonization of fossil fuels. However, many research works contain renewables in the design of CCU systems, which may mislead stakeholders regarding the hotspots of CCU systems. Herein, this work builds a CCU system with no renewables involved, and evaluates its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on the life cycle assessment with a cradle-to-gate boundary. To pursue the best system performance, an optimization framework is established to digitalize and optimize the CCU system regarding GHG emissions reduction. The optimized CCU can reduce GHG emissions by 13% compared with the conventional process. Heating is identified as the most significant contributor to GHG emissions, accounting for 60%. Electrifying heating fully using low-carbon electricity can further reduce GHG emissions by 47%, but such extreme conditions will significantly sacrifice the economic benefit. By contrast, the multi-objective optimization can show how the decisions can affect the balance between GHG emissions and profit. Furthermore, this work discusses the dual effect of carbon pricing on the CCU system - raising the cost of raw materials and utilities, but also gaining credits when emissions are reduced in producing valued products.

AB  - The Sembawang Hot Spring in Singapore lies at the foot of a major regional geological feature called the Bentong-Raub Suture Zone. Amid an extensively managed surface geothermal park, an undisturbed hot spring emerges with source water at 61 & DEG;C, pH 6.8, and 1 mg/L dissolved sulfide. A small main pool at the source supported orange-green benthic flocs, whereas the outflow channel with gradually less extreme environmental stress supported extensive vivid green microbial mats. Microscopy revealed that cyanobacterial morphotypes were distinct in flocs and mats at several intervals along the environmental gradient, and we describe a spiraling pattern in the oscillatorian cyanobacteria that may reflect response to poly-extreme stress. Estimation of diversity using 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed assemblages that were dominated by phototrophic bacteria. The most abundant taxa in flocs at 61 & DEG;C/1 mg/L sulfide were Roseiflexus sp. and Thermosynechococcus elongatus, whilst the mats at 45.7-55.3 & DEG;C/0-0.5 mg/L sulfide were dominated by Oscillatoriales cyanobacterium MTP1 and Chloroflexus sp. Occurrence of diverse chemoautotrophs and heterotrophs reflected known thermal ranges for taxa, and of note was the high abundance of thermophilic cellulolytic bacteria that likely reflected the large allochthonous leaf input. A clear shift in ASV-defined putative ecotypes occurred along the environmental stress gradient of the hot spring and overall diversity was inversely correlated to environmental stress. Significant correlations for abiotic variables with observed biotic diversity were identified for temperature, sulfide, and carbonate. A network analysis revealed three putative modules of biotic interactions that also reflected the taxonomic composition at intervals along the environmental gradient. Overall, the data indicated that three distinct microbial communities were supported within a small spatial scale along the poly-extreme environmental gradient. The findings add to the growing inventory of hot spring microbiomes and address an important biogeographic knowledge gap for the region.

AB  - Extreme high temperature (EHT) events have caused serious impact on society. In previous research, EHT indices seldom consider spatial aggregation. To conduct the comprehensive evaluation, the global EHT days from 1979 to 2017 have been evaluated in terms of high temperature duration, accumulative temperature intensities and magnitude of spatial aggregation based on ERA-Interim 2 m air temperature data set. In addition, abnormal warming of polar and ocean surfaces has rarely been addressed in global-scale studies. To address this deficiency, the indices of EHT days are normalized by maximum in history for each location. To solve the time discontinuity problem on EHT spatiotemporal distribution in previous studies, we utilized spatiotemporal scan statistics to detect EHT spatiotemporal clusters (EHT-STCs), and clusters correspond to a certain spatiotemporal extent where the EHT events are aggregated. This method actualizes time-continuous and spatiotemporal integral detection. The results show the following: 1. There are apparent changes in EHT-STC spatial distribution after 1999, so 1999 can be recognized as the critical time node of EHT-STC spatial transformation. 2. After 1999, the EHT-STC number gradually increased, and the duration and spatial coverage of EHT-STC gradually expanded. Overall, EHT-STCs display a significant northward migration, with an average northward movement of 7.03 degrees for each transition from 1979 to 2017. 3. There are differences in the extremity and transformation process in different regions. EHT-STCs in Antarctica are concentrated before 1992, with the strongest EHT extremity; EHT-STCs in the Arctic and middle-low latitude continents are concentrated after 2010 and 1999 respectively, both with a strong EHT extremity. There is a similar EHT-STC number in the middle-low latitude ocean before and after 1999 with the weakest extremity. These results contribute to determining EHT causes and future trends in global climate change.

AB  - Climate change is one of the most significant environmental issues facing communities, while poor construction and absence of effective air-conditioning (AC) predominantly cause indoor overheating. Although AC may help meeting indoor comfort, it increases the vulnerability of low-income residents, triggers large energy consumption, and generates anthropogenic heat, which worsens heat stress out-door. The capacity of buildings to maintain comfortable thermal conditions without mechanical cooling is the key factor protecting occupants against the rising temperature. Residents of Darwin, Australia, will be largely affected by increasing temperature where the annual peak ambient temperature may increase by 7.4 degrees C in 2060, while the number of hours above 30 degrees C will rise by 70%. Based on regional climate modelling for the Australian area and using a building energy simulation platform, we computed that by 2060 the indoor air temperature in a typical residential building may exceed 30 degrees C for over 4000 h under free-floating condition, with a peak daytime and night-time temperatures of 39 degrees C and 36.5 degrees C, respectively. The sensible thermal energy need for cooling per unit area under thermostatically controlled condition will increase from the current level of 110.7 kWh/m 2 to 196.8 kWh/m(2) in 2060. Different adaptation techniques when applied to the typical residential building yield to the peak indoor air temperature drop by 3.3-12 degrees C, and cooling energy needs reductions by 23.5-195.3 kWh/m(2) (12-99.7%) for low, medium, and high retrofit buildings compared to the typical residential building in 2060. Our study indicates that improved building quality is necessary to enhance survivability and energy efficiency in Darwin considering the role of building adaptation measures to counterbalance the impacts of global warming.

AB  - The provision of housing for displaced victims is fundamental to their survival. Although many studies have detailed reasonable techniques for improving the indoor thermal environment in certain types of post-disaster temporary residential buildings (PDTRB), comprehensive and in-depth insight into PDTRB has been lacking to date. In this study, the characteristics, influencing factors, and improvement measures for the indoor thermal environment of PDTRB were comprehensively reviewed using 74 papers and 15 reports. The enclosure structure, indoor environmental characteristics, thermal comfort study methods, and active and passive cooling and heating measures of PDTRB were assessed and improvements were suggested. The findings show that the insulation performance of selected enclosure structure materials is the main current research direction and sustainable materials are the future trend. The indoor temperature and humidity showed extreme data in most cases. Based on existing standards and models, the thermal comfort level was 26.47%. Victims' thermal adaptation and psychological subjective factors exhibited a strong influence, and more precise methods are required to be urgently established for evaluating thermal comfort. Passive technologies can partly resolve extreme discomfort. The concept of self-sufficient passive housing is worth trying, and the development of available active technologies is also essential. This review may help to improve the practicality of PDTRB globally, and also advance the related technologies.

AB  - To investigate the dynamic response and fire performance of steel beams under high temperature, drop hammer impact tests and numerical simulations were conducted on steel beams subjected to high temperatures. Three finite element (FE) models were established using the element coupling method to predict the impact dynamic behavior of the steel beams under the combined effects of fire and impact loads. The reliability and applicability of the developed FE models in predicting the impact dynamic response of steel beams in fire was examined through comparison of numerical results with experimental results. Based on the experimentally and numerically observed failure modes, a generalized plastic yield criterion for I-shaped steel beams section was proposed, which considers the synergistic effects of axial force, shear force, bending moment, strain rate, and temperature with the plastic deformation of the entire cross section as the criterion. The interaction functions and spatial characteristics between internal forces were presented. A new generalized yield (G-Y) method for evaluating the failure of components due to plastic hinges development without restricting the load type was proposed based on four types of interaction relationships combination, and the sensitivity of the G-Y method to different parameters for assessing the development of plastic hinges was systematically studied. Based on the proposed G-Y method, the mechanical behavior of steel beam subjected to multiple extreme load coupling effects was revealed.

AB  - The accumulation of municipal solid wastes (MSW) and the negative implications of using fossil fuels are some of the current environmental issues in the Philippines. Hence, this study aimed to utilize MSW by converting it into biochar through pyrolysis and maximize biochar production for energy application. The effects of pyrolysis parameters such as temperature and holding time on biochar yield were initially determined using 2k factorial experiment. Results showed that both factors had negative effects on biochar yield wherein temperature had a relatively higher impact. For the optimization study, Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was performed to determine the optimum pyrolysis conditions for maximum biochar production. The optimum conditions were found to be 300 degrees C and 20 min holding time resulting to maximum biochar yield of 69.64 % by wt. Biochar characteristics were evaluated in terms of higher heating value (HHV), proximate and elemental analyses to determine its suitability as alternative fuel. The HHV of biochar obtained at optimum conditions was about 15.82 MJ/kg which is higher compared to that of the raw MSW (14.42 MJ/kg) and biochar obtained at extreme conditions (13.03 MJ/kg). Moreover, the energy recovery at optimum conditions based on biochar yield was about 76.37% which was also higher compared to that of the biochar obtained at higher temperature and holding time which was about 32.75 %. Using van Krevelen diagram, MSW-derived biochar at the optimum conditions can be classified as lignite, while MSW-derived biochar at extreme conditions is comparable to anthracite coal.

AB  - Climate warming is considered to be among the most serious of anthropogenic stresses to the environment, because it not only has direct effects on biodiversity, but it also exacerbates the harmful effects of other human-mediated threats. The associated consequences are potentially severe, particularly in terms of threats to species preservation, as well as in the preservation of an array of ecosystem services provided by biodiversity. Among the most affected groups of animals are insects-central components of many ecosystems-for which climate change has pervasive effects from individuals to communities. In this contribution to the scientists' warning series, we summarize the effect of the gradual global surface temperature increase on insects, in terms of physiology, behavior, phenology, distribution, and species interactions, as well as the effect of increased frequency and duration of extreme events such as hot and cold spells, fires, droughts, and floods on these parameters. We warn that, if no action is taken to better understand and reduce the action of climate change on insects, we will drastically reduce our ability to build a sustainable future based on healthy, functional ecosystems. We discuss perspectives on relevant ways to conserve insects in the face of climate change, and we offer several key recommendations on management approaches that can be adopted, on policies that should be pursued, and on the involvement of the general public in the protection effort.

AB  - Background The widespread Indo-Pacific coral species Pocillopora acuta Lamarck, 1816 displays varying levels of asexual versus sexual reproduction, with strong repercussions on genetic diversity, connectivity and genetic structuring within and among populations. For many geographic regions, baseline information on genetic diversity is still lacking, particularly in the Andaman Sea. The region suffered a massive heat-induced bleaching event in 2010 with high coral cover loss of branching coral species such as P. acuta. A subsequent bleaching in 2016, however, revealed a mild bleaching response in pocilloporids compared to other coral taxa in the region, suggesting that rare, heat tolerant genotypes had been selected by the 2010 bleaching event. In order to test whether this potential 'evolutionary rescue' event has led to a low genetic diversity, we conducted a population genetic survey covering a total of nine different P. acuta populations (336 individuals) along a 50 km coastal stretch around Phuket Island, Thailand. We used six microsatellite markers to assess genotypic diversity and to determine the prevalent mode of reproduction (i.e. sexual or asexual recruitment).Results In contrast to other Indian Ocean P. acuta populations, the majority of corals in this study adopted a sexual reproduction mode (75% across all populations). At the same time, substantial regional gene flow was observed around Phuket Island with strong genetic differentiation as indicated by three genetic clusters that were separated by only a few kilometers. Patterns of isolation by distance over 0.7 - 40 km suggest small-scale genetic barriers, such as changing currents throughout each monsoonal season, potentially contributing to locally restricted dispersal of P. acuta larvae.Conclusions The occurrence of distinct genetic clusters within short coastal stretches suggests that the 2010 bleaching event has not led to extreme genetic impoverishment. While more in-depth genomic analyses are necessary to investigate changes in genetic diversity following extreme bleaching events, our results will help guide conservation efforts to maintain genetic diversity of a coral species that likely will be dominant in future, warmer Andaman Sea reefs.

AB  - Estimations of cutting-tool wear and rock-breaking efficiency during underground excavation and geo-energy extraction rely mostly on Cerchar abrasivity index (CAI) tests. However, the measurement of rock abrasivity may not be accurate for highly cracked rock after extreme treatment conditions (e.g., high temperature and rapid cooling). Here we conduct CAI tests on granite specimens after thermal treatment with different combinations of heating temperature and cooling rate. The results show that the CAI value is mainly increased during the first few millimeters scratching distance and strongly influenced by the stylus indentation during the subsequent scratching distance. We examine the stylus and rock interaction based on P-wave velocity and acoustic emission and suggest evaluating the wear flat by reconstructing intact stylus profile. A scratching distance of 10 mm is appliable for highly cracked rock with an acceptable measurement error. We finally discuss the evolution of rock brittleness that fundamentally controls the stylus indentation.

AB  - Concrete is susceptible to chemical attack and temperature changes, especially when exposed to extreme heat, which raises the internal pore water pressure. When used as a fine aggregate replacement in concrete, crumb rubber can help to avoid spatting by allowing the pore water pressure to escape when the temperature is high. However, research shows that when rubberized concrete is compared to ordinary concrete, its fresh properties degrade. To overcome the problem caused by material composition change, nanomaterials have been introduced as enhancing admixture. Concrete elements are exposed to a harsh environment such as acidic conditions. Hardened cementitious matrix undergoes deterioration when being attacked by different acids and various concentrations. When acids are being encountered with a cement-based matrix, the high solubility of salts is produced and induces a high amount of porosity, eventually producing shorter service life and increased expenditures.

AB  - Present work investigated the effects of processing (homogenization, sterilization) and cold storage on physicochemical properties, in vitro digestion and Caco-2 cellular uptake of bovine milk. Extreme heat sterilization and low temperature storage have significant impact on particle size and phospholipidome of bovine milk. In addition, cold storage of bovine milks led to formation of beta' polymorphs crystals and endothermic peak with Toffset higher than body temperature. Processing and cold storage also increased the initial digestibility but reduced the overall digestibility of bovine milk. This might be related to the decreased particle size of the milk fat globules, changed in the phospholipidome of the MFGM and formation of beta' polymorphs crystals in frozen milk. It is interesting to note that PE has relatively faster digestion meanwhile SM has relatively slower digestion. HTST milk which demonstrated lesser changed in terms of phospholipidome demonstrated highest cellular uptakes of most fatty acids.

AB  - Advanced control over the excitation of ultraconfined polaritons-hybrid light and matter waves-empowers unique opportunities for many nanophotonic functionalities, e.g., on-chip circuits, quantum information processing, and controlling thermal radiation. Recent work has shown that highly asymmetric polaritons are directly governed by asymmetries in crystal structures. Here, we experimentally demonstrate extremely asymmetric and unidirectional phonon polariton (PhP) excitation via directly patterning high-symmetry orthorhombic van der Waals (vdW) crystal alpha-MoO3. This phenomenon results from symmetry breaking of momentum matching in polaritonic diffraction in vdW materials. We show that the propagation of PhPs can be versatile and robustly tailored via structural engineering, while PhPs in low-symmetry (e.g., monoclinic and triclinic) crystals are largely restricted by their naturally occurring permittivities. Our work synergizes grating diffraction phenomena with the extreme anisotropy of high-symmetry vdW materials, enabling unexpected control of infrared polaritons along different pathways and opening opportunities for applications ranging from on-chip photonics to directional heat dissipation.

AB  - Melting behaviors of defective crystals under extreme conditions are theoretically investigated using the statistical moment method. In our theoretical model, heating processes cause missing atoms or vacancies in crystal structures via dislocating them from their equilibrium positions. The coordination number of some atoms is assumed to be removed by one unit and the defect depends on temperature and external pressure. We formulate analytical expressions to directly connect the equilibrium vacancy concentration, the elastic modulus, and the melting temperature. Numerical calculations are carried out for six transition metals including Cu, Ag, Au, Mo, Ta, and W up to 400 GPa. The obtained results show that vacancies strongly drive the melting transition. Ignoring the vacancy formation leads to incorrect predictions of the melting point. The good agreement between our numerical data and prior experimental works validates the accuracy of our approach.

AB  - Coral bleaching, caused by the loss of brownish-colored dinoflagellate photosymbionts from the host tissue of reef-building corals, is a major threat to reef survival. Occasionally, bleached corals become exceptionally colorful rather than white. These colors derive from photoprotective green fluorescent protein (GFP)-like pigments produced by the coral host. There is currently no consensus regarding what causes colorful bleaching events and what the consequences for the corals are. Here, we document that colorful bleaching events are a recurring phenomenon in reef regions around the globe. Our analysis of temperature conditions associated with colorful bleaching events suggests that corals develop extreme coloration within 2 to 3 weeks after exposure to mild or temporary heat stress. We demonstrate that the increase of light fluxes in symbiontdepleted tissue promoted by reflection of the incident light from the coral skeleton induces strong expression of the photoprotective coral host pigments. We describe an optical feedback loop involving both partners of the association, discussing that themitigation of light stress offered by host pigments could facilitate recolonization of bleached tissue by symbionts. Our data indicate that colorful bleaching has the potential to identify local environmental factors, such as nutrient stress, that can exacerbate the impact of elevated temperatures on corals, to indicate the severity of heat stress experienced by corals and to gauge their post-stress recovery potential.

AB  - A novel approach to identify 5 types of simulated stresses that induce protein aggregation in prefilled syringe type biopharmaceuticals was developed. Principal components analyses of texture metrics extracted from flow imaging microscopy images were used to define subgroups of particles. Supervised machine learning methods, including convolutional neural networks, were used to train classifiers to identify subgroup membership of constituent particles to generate distribution profiles. The applicability of the stress-specific signatures for distinguishing stress source types was verified. The high classification efficiencies (100%) precipitated the collection of data from more than 20 independent experiments to train support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, and ensemble classifiers. The performances of the trained classifiers were validated. High classification efficiencies for friability (80%-100%) and heating at 90 degrees C (85%-100%) are indicative of high reliability of these methods for stress-stability assays while extreme variations in freeze -thawing (2%-100%) and heating at 60 degrees C (2.25%-98.25%) indicate the unpredictability of particle composition profiles for these forced degradation conditions. We also developed subvisible particle classifiers using convolutional neural network to automatically identify silicone oil droplets, air bubbles, and protein aggregates. The developed classifiers will contribute to mitigating aggregation in biopharmaceuticals via the identification of stress sources. (C) 2020 American Pharmacists Association.

AB  - Alumina is widely used in the automotive, electrical component and aircraft industries due to its low thermal conductivity and high hardness. However, alumina is notoriously difficult to machine due to its extreme hardness. According to some researchers, laser machining offers a cost-effective machining technique for alumina. Even though many works on laser machining of alumina have been published, most have focused on thin alumina plates. This study determined the effect of a CO2 laser machining method on hole quality in terms of the heat-affected zone (HAZ) and taper angle for 3 mm alumina thickness. Design of Experiment (DOE) was performed to identify the effect of laser power and frequency on the output findings. The HAZ and the taper angle were measured using a Scanning Electron Microscopy image. Based on the ANOVA analysis, HAZ and taper angles were influenced by the laser power input. The HAZ thickness increased as laser power and frequency decreased, but the taper angle decreased as frequency decreased. Low laser power (50 W) resulted in a small inlet diameter (0.236 mm), while high laser power (150 W) resulted in a larger inlet diameter (0.272 mm). Multi-response optimization analysis for both HAZ and taper angle showed that 149 W and 2956 Hz frequency were the optimum process parameters which yielded the best output conditions

AB  - Thermal stress due to extreme changes in the thermal environment is a critical issue in cattle production. Many previous findings have shown a decrease in feed intake, milk yield, growth rate, and reproductive efficiency of cattle when subjected to thermal stress. Therefore, selecting thermo-tolerant animals is the primary goal of the efficiency of breeding programs to reduce those adverse impacts. The recent advances in molecular genetics have provided significant breeding advantages that allow the identification of molecular markers in both beef and dairy cattle breeding, including marker-assisted selection (MAS) as a tool in selecting superior thermo-tolerant animals. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which can be detected by DNA sequencing, are desirable DNA markers for MAS due to their abundance in the genome's coding and non-coding regions. Many SNPs in some genes (e.g., HSP70, HSP90, HSF1, EIF2AK4, HSBP1, HSPB8, HSPB7, MYO1A, and ATP1A1) in various breeds of cattle have been analyzed to play key roles in many cellular activities during thermal stress and protecting cells against stress, making them potential candidate genes for molecular markers of thermotolerance. This review highlights the associations of SNPs within these genes with thermotolerance traits (e.g., blood biochemistry and physiological responses) and suggests their potential use as MAS in thermotolerant cattle breeding.

AB  - The thermal performance of a flat plate solar collector using MWCNT + Fe3O4/Water hybrid nanofluids was examined in this research. The flat plate solar collector was tested using different nanofluid concentrations and flow rates in an arid environment. A significant enhancement in coefficient of heat transfer (26.3%) with a marginal loss on pressure drop due to friction factor (18.9%). The data collected during experimental testing was utilized to develop novel prediction models for efficient heat transfer, Nusselt's number, friction factor, and thermal efficiency. The modern ensemble machine learning techniques Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were used to develop prognostic models for each parameter. A battery of statistical methods and Taylor's graphs were used to compare the performance of these two modern ML techniques. The value of R2 for the BRT-based prediction models were 0.9619 -0.9994 and 0.9914 -0.9997 for XGBoost-based models. The mean squared error was quite low for all the models (0.000081 -9.11), while the mean absolute percentage error was negligible from 0.0025 to 0.3114. The comprehensive statistical analysis of the prognostic model was com-plemented with Taylor's graphs to develop an improved comparison paradigm, to reveal the superiority of XGBoost over BRT.

AB  - Seawater membrane distillation (SWMD) is a promising separation technology due to its ability to operate as a stand-alone desalination unit operation. This paper reviews approaches to improve laboratory-to-pilot-scale MD performance, which comprise operational strategies, module design, and specifically tailored membranes. A detailed comparison of SWMD and sea water reverse osmosis is presented to further analyze the critical shortcomings of SWMD. The unique features of SWMD, namely the ability to operate with extremely high salt rejection and at extreme feed concentration, highlight the SWMD potential to be operated under zero liquid discharge (ZLD) conditions, which results in the production of high-purity water and simultaneous salt recovery, as well as the elimination of the brine disposal cost. However, technical challenges, such as thermal energy requirements, inefficient heat transfer and integration, low water recovery factors, and lack of studies on real-case valuable-salt recovery, are impeding the commercialization of ZLD SWMD. This review highlights the possibility of applying selected strategies to push forward ZLD SWMD commercialization. Suggestions are projected to include intermittent removal of valuable salts, in-depth study on the robustness of novel membranes, module and configuration, utilization of a low-cost heat exchanger, and capital cost reduction in a renewable-energy-integrated SWMD plant.

AB  - Electric vehicles (EVs) can significantly reduce pollution and dependence on fossil fuels by taking the place of conventional gasoline-powered vehicles. Owing to the higher sensitivity of lithium-ion batteries (LIB) towards working temperatures, thermal management of the battery is necessary for guaranteeing longer-cycle life, higher performance, and the safe operation of EV power systems. Moreover, increasing the rate capability of LIB is highly advantageous to the expediency of EVs application. During the higher charging process, Li-inventory loss, and thermal runaway are pretty obvious. Thus, an effective and advanced battery management system (BTMS) is required to control and dissipate the generated heat from battery cells/pouches/modules. From this perspective, the present review summarizes the latest developments in advanced LIB thermal management for high charge/ discharge cycles. Firstly, the severe thermal issue caused by high temperature during fast charging rate and its effect on performance degradation and thermal runway are discussed. The existing advanced BTMS such as cold plate, composite phase change materials (PCMs), hybrid BTMS with PCMs and liquid cooling, and heat pipes are then elaborately presented in the view of fast charging/discharging rate along with the pros and cons. Some new and efficient emerging BTMS, such as refrigerant, thermo-electric and immersion cooling methods for the future BTMS are analyzed. In order to satisfy the thermal requirements, predominantly in dynamic conditions through fast charging rate along with extreme power fluctuations, a combined active and passive cooling mode for BTMS is suggested. This state-of-the-art critical review provides recommendations for the development of advanced BTMS for the batteries under fast charging.

AB  - Walking through street markets is the most popular outdoor activity in Thailand, promoting local economies and tourism. In the year-round hot and humid conditions, living outdoors with long heat exposure throughout the midday can result in heat-related illness. Artificial shade structures and tree shade canopies are typical cooling strategies to protect market sellers and pedestrians from direct sun exposure and improve outdoor human thermal comfort in the street market. This study investigates microclimate conditions and cooling benefits of typical street market shade structures with different settings-three roofing materials, two roof shapes, and surrounding trees with dense and sparse canopies. The dimension of the single artificial shade was 2 m x 2 m with heights varying 2-2.5 m. The vertical air temperature and sky view factor profiles were measured on winter and summer days. The calculated physiological equivalent temperatures (PET) and thermal comfortable hours beneath different shade structures were assessed using RayMan 1.2 software. A cluster of trees with a dense canopy provided more effective cooling (with a satisfied thermal condition of 9 h) than artificial shade structures. Thermal conditions under the galvanized steel roofing and HDPE tarpaulin plastic roofing shades were cooler than those of polycarbonate roofing shade. Meanwhile, the space beneath the sparse tree canopy had the warmest condition. The temperature reductions beneath the artificial shade structure varied throughout the day, with the maximum reduction occurring during midday and the lowest reduction found in the late morning and late afternoon. Our study demonstrates that the tree canopies and artificial shade structures had limited application for providing comfortable conditions throughout midday. To reduce such extreme heat, a combination of shade structures with other cooling techniques is suggested, which should be the focus for further studies.

AB  - The December 2022 Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey conducted by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) found that space heating constitutes 32% of total building enduse energy, with cooling accounting for 9%. It has a significant impact on climate change. In this research, intelligent models were developed to predict the annual heating and cooling loads (HL and CL) of residential buildings. Eight inputs, including relative compactness, roof area, overall height, surface area, glazing area, wall area, glazing area distribution, and orientation, were used for the modeling development. The artificial intelligence (AI) models were Support Vector Regression (SVR), K -Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Multi -layer Perceptron (MLP), Gradient Boosting (GBoost), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Three scenarios of input combinations were tested: Scenario -1 (S1) with eight inputs and Scenario -2 (S2) with five inputs. Similarly, Scenario -3 (S3) with five inputs. Results indicated that, the RF was the superior algorithm in HL for S1, achieving Kling -Gupta Efficiency (KGE = 0.998) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE = 0.501 kW h/m 2 ). XGBoost performed outstandingly in CL with KGE = 0.994 and RMSE = 0.922 kW h/m 2 . In S2, KNN showed excellent HL with KGE = 0.945 and RMSE = 3.094 kW h/m 2 , and RF outperformed in CL with KGE = 0.941 and RMSE = 2.727 kW h/m 2 . In S3, XGBoost exhibited the highest efficiency for HL with KGE = 0.997 and RMSE = 0.492 kW h/m 2 , while RF performed best for CL with KGE = 0.976 and RMSE = 1.686 kW h/m 2 . In conclusion, S2 proved to be a logical choice, matching the efficiency of S1 with reduced error. Overall, HL predictions generally displayed superior performance compared to CL predictions.

AB  - Extreme high thermal conditions on tropical rocky shores are challenging to the survival of intertidal ectotherms. Yet, many species are highly successful in these environments in part due to their ability to regulate intrinsic mechanisms associated with physiological stress and their metabolic demand. More recently, there has been a growing awareness that other extrinsic mechanisms, such as animal-associated microbial communities, can also influence the tolerance and survival of ectotherms under stressful conditions. However, the extent to which the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms are functionally linked as part of the overall adaptive response of intertidal animals to temperature change and stress is poorly understood. Here, we examined the dynamics and potential interactions of intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms in the tropical high-supratidal oyster, Isognomon nucleus. We found that oysters modulate their internal biochemistry (oxidized PUFA products, including 5-F2t-IsoP, 10-F4tNeuroP, 13-F4t-NeuroP, and 16-F1t-PhytoP) as part of their adaptive regulation to cope with physiological stress during periods of extreme high temperatures when emersed. However, while we detected variation in alpha diversity (ASV richness and Shannon diversity index), dominant microbial taxa and microbial functions across time, no association was found with the host biochemical profiles. The findings here suggest that the thermal condition within oysters can independently influence their intrinsic biochemical responses and extrinsic microbiome profiles. Together, these mechanisms may contribute to the thermal tolerance and survival of the oysters in the challenging conditions of the tropical high-supratidal zone.

AB  - Extreme fires in the peatlands of South East (SE) Asia are arguably the world's greatest biomass burning events, resulting in some of the worst ambient air pollution ever recorded (PM10 > 3000 mu g.m(-3)). The worst of these fires coincide with El Nino related droughts, and include huge areas of smouldering combustion that can persist for months. However, areas of flaming surface vegetation combustion atop peat are also seen, and we show that the largest of these latter fires appear to be the most radiant and intensely smoke-emitting areas of combustion present in such extreme fire episodes. Fire emissions inventories and early warning of the air quality impacts of landscape fire are increasingly based on the fire radiative power (FRP) approach to fire emissions estimation, including for these SE Asia peatland fires. "Top-down" methods estimate total particulate matter emissions directly from FRP observations using so-called "smoke emission coefficients" [C-e; g.MJ(-1)], but currently no discrimination is made between fire types during such calculations. We show that for a subset of some of the most thermally radiant peatland fires seen during the 2015 El Nino, the most appropriate C-e is around a factor of three lower than currently assumed (similar to 16.8 +/- 1.6 g.MJ(-1) vs. 52.4 g.MJ(-1)). Analysis indicates that this difference stems from these highly radiant fires containing areas of substantial flaming combustion, which changes the amount of particulate matter emitted per unit of observable fire radiative heat release in comparison to more smouldering dominated events. We also show that even a single one of these most radiant fires is responsible for almost 10% of the overall particulate matter released during the 2015 fire event, highlighting the importance of this fire type to overall emission totals. Discriminating these different fires types in ways demonstrated herein should thus ultimately improve the accuracy of SE Asian fire emissions estimates derived using the FRP approach, and the air quality modelling which they support.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to investigate changes in genetic parameters for milk yield (MY) and heat tolerance of the crossbred Thai Holstein Friesian population under different heat stress levels over time, and to investigate the threshold point of heat stress manifestation on milk production. Genetic parameters were estimated using single-step genomic REML (ssGREML) and traditional REML models. Data included 58,965 test-day MY records from 1999 to 2008 (old data) and 105,485 test-day MY records from 2009 to 2018 (recent data) from the first parity of 24,520 cows. The pedigree included 55,168 animals, of which 882 animals had genotypes. Variance components were estimated with the REMLF90 program using a repeatability model with random regressions on a function of temperature-humidity index (THI) for additive genetic and permanent environmental effects. Fixed effects included farm-calving season combination, breed group months in milk combination, and age at first calving. Random effects included additive genetic (intercept and slope) effects, permanent environmental (intercept and slope) effects, and herd-month-year of test. The phenotypic mean for MY was 13.33 +/- 4.39 kg/d in the old data, and 14.48 +/- 4.40 kg/d in the recent data. Estimates over different THI levels for the intercept additive genetic variance using old data ranged from 2.61 to 2.77 and from 5.02 to 5.38 using recent data with the REML method. In ssGREML analyses (performed with recent data only) the estimates for the intercept additive genetic variance ranged from 4.71 to 5.05. Estimates for the slope additive genetic variance were close to zero in all cases, with the largest values (0.024-0.030) at the most extreme THI value (80). Using REML, the covariance between the intercept and the slope additive genetic effects (THI from 72 to 80) ranged from -0.001 to 0.019 with old data and from 0.027 to 0.060 with recent data. The same covariance ranged from 0.026 to 0.057 in ssGREML analyses. The covariance between the intercept and the slope permanent environmental effects ranged from -0.42 to -0.67 for all data and THI levels. Across THI levels, the genetic correlation between MY and heat tolerance varied from -0.06 to 0.13 with old data, from 0.16 to 0.30 with recent data in REML analyses, and from 0.15 to 0.30 in ssGREML analyses, suggesting that in the current population the top animals for MY are more resistant to heat stress. This was expected, because of the introduction of Bos indicus genes in the last years. Heritability estimates for MY ranged from 0.19 to 0.21 (old data) and from 0.33 to 0.40 (recent data) for REML analyses. Heritability estimates for MY using ssGREML ranged from 0.31 to 0.38. A decline in MY was found when the animals' breed composition had more than 97.3% of Holstein genetics, and it was greatest at THI 80. The heritability and genetic correlations observed in this study show that selection for MY is possible without a negative correlated response for heat tolerance. Although the inclusion of genomic information is expected to increase the accuracy of selection, more genotypes must be collected for successful application. Future research should address other production and fitness traits within the Thai Holstein population.

AB  - Fire and extreme heat environmental changes can have an impact on concrete performance, and as climate change increases, new concrete structures are being developed. Nano-silica and nano-calcium carbonate have shown excellent performances in modifying concrete due to their large specific surface areas. This review describes the changes in concrete modified with nano-silica (NS) and nano-calcium carbonate (NC), which accelerate the hydration reaction with the cementitious materials to produce more C-S-H, resulting in a denser microstructure and improved mechanical properties and durability of the concrete. The mechanical property decay and visualization of deformation of mixed NS and NC concrete were tested by exposure to high temperatures to investigate the practical application of mixed composite nanomaterials (NC+NS) to concrete. The nano-modified concrete had better overall properties and was heated at 200 degrees C, 400 degrees C, 600 degrees C and 800 degrees C to relatively improve the mechanical properties of the nano concrete structures. The review concluded that high temperatures of 800 degrees C to 1000 degrees C severely damaged the structure of the concrete, reducing the mechanical properties by around 60%, and the dense nano concrete structures were more susceptible to cracking and damage. The high temperature resistance of NS and NC-modified nano concrete was relatively higher than that of normal concrete, with NC concrete being more resistant to damage at high temperatures than the NS samples.

AB  - This study presents a liquid separation fryer using the principle of heat transfer between different liquids, oil, and water, to be used as a hot and cold fluid in the frying process, respectively. It causes small pieces of food to fall into the water zone, causing no burns, which causes the fried oil not to be black and smokeless while cooking. This study was comparing the efficiency of the frying results between the liquid separation fryer with the conventional frying pans at the same process is 180 degrees C of oil temperature, use the polar test set to measure the quality of the oil. The results found that the number of frying process in liquid separation fryer has 27 times more than regarding the amount of an extreme in used by conventional frying pans. From the prototype experiment, the fuel frying rate was reduced by 16.79%, causing the production cost to decrease by 20.6%. The production volume was more than 20.1% than the conventional pan; because of this, the liquid separation fryer has a temperature-controlled to save the amount of gas used.

These rapid changes coupled with a transparent world that enjoys access to information mean that today's population is more aware and attentive about the progress of climate change. The purpose of this study is to discover attitudes towards new gained consciousness and the term Eco-anxiety. The American Psychological Association (APA) defines eco-anxiety as a 'chronic fear of environmental doom'. To investigate this phenomenon, we use Q-methodology to analyse discourses on the topic. Thirty-nine people from four different stakeholder groups were surveyed. Five distinct discourses were generated covering the connection between environmental awareness and psychological well-being, coming to terms with emotional response to climate change, importance of climate change, awareness about eco-anxiety leading to a more positive outlook, and disbelief that eco-anxiety and climate change can affect mental well-being.

AB  - This paper investigates the relationship between temperature and hospitalization in China. Using inpatient visit claims of two major public insurance schemes covering 47 cities in 28 provinces for three years, we see a 7.3% increase in hospital admissions on days on which the average temperature is above 27 degrees C, and a 2% increase in 31-day cumulative hospital admissions relative to a benchmark-temperature day in the subsequent weeks. Such an effect is much larger than evidence from developed economies. Using detailed information on medical bills, we calculate that an additional hot day nationwide is associated with approximately 2 billion yuan (roughly equivalent to 0.3 billion US dollars) increase in medical expenses that are related to inpatient services, 1.9 billion yuan (roughly equivalent to 0.29 billion US dollars) of which is borne by the public insurance system, and 0.2 billion yuan (roughly equivalent to 0.01 billion US dollars) of which is borne by the insured.

AB  - El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is an opposing natural climate phenomenon in which the El Nino event causes droughts and the La Nina event causes floods. Literature studies stated there is still a lack of studies on the application of remote sensing in studying the effect of ENSO on Urban Heat Island (UHI) distribution patterns. The effect of UHI amplifies temperature, especially during El Nino. The objective of this study is to examine the influence of ENSO on UHI formation in tropical cities on a local scale. This study uses MODIS data and Landsat satellite data from 1988 to 2019. This study uses a combination of both data to investigate the influence of ENSO on UHI formation. The data must undergo pre-processing before the digital number is converted to Land Surface Temperature (LST). This study found that La Nina and El Nino events influenced the pattern of UHI variation. The strength of El Nino and La Nina differences influenced the value of LST and the total UHI area with a temperature of 30 degrees C. The result discovered that during the El Nino event, the maximum, minimum and mean temperature values of LST were higher than during the La Nina event and the total of the area hot spots that have temperatures above 30 degrees C is higher during El Nino than during La Nina. The result of the study is very important to the community, local governments, and urban planners because remote sensing provides spatial information that represents the hot spot and cold spot.

AB  - The evaluation of buoyancy effect on urban ventilation, especially on low wind conditions, is important for the extreme urban heat islands to improve urban climate resilience. To provide suggestions for reliable climate simulation study in the future and support the development of city-scale outdoor ventilation models, this study conducted a critical literature review on buoyancy effects on outdoor natural ventilation. First, on the neighborhood scale, this study summarized computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations on urban ventilation with buoyancy effects to provide suggestions on improving simulation accuracy. Suggestions on the computational mesh, turbulence models, and wall functions, as well as the realistic wall surface temperature models coupling, are provided. Furthermore, the newly emerged non-isothermal wind tunnel measurements are summarized to support future validation studies. We highlight the importance of using Large-Eddy Simulation model under weak wind and intense wind-buoyancy interaction scenarios. The Building Energy Model (BEM) is recommended to calculate the surface temperature and couple it into CFD models. Secondly, on the urban scale, in order to support the parameterization of buoyancy effect on air exchange velocity, correlations between air exchange velocity and non-dimensional parameters are explored based on existing simulation results. A linear correlation is found between the street canyon buoyancy parameter and air exchange velocity improvement. This review suggests that the current database of air exchange velocity is sparse and limited at a narrow range of buoyancy intensity and urban densities, and thus emphasizes the need for future studies on strong buoyancy and weak wind conditions.

AB  - Background Short episodes of high temperature (HT) stress during reproductive stages of development cause significant yield losses in wheat (Triticum aestivumL.). Two independent experiments were conducted to quantify the effects of HT during anthesis and grain filling periods on photosynthesis, leaf lipidome, and yield traits in wheat. In experiment I, wheat genotype Seri82 was exposed to optimum temperature (OT; 22/14 degrees C; day/night) or HT (32/22 degrees C) for 14 d during anthesis stage. In experiment II, the plants were exposed to OT or HT for 14 d during the grain filling stage. During the HT stress, chlorophyll index, thylakoid membrane damage, stomatal conductance, photosynthetic rate and leaf lipid composition were measured. At maturity, grain yield and its components were quantified. Results HT stress during anthesis or grain filling stage decreased photosynthetic rate (17 and 25%, respectively) and grain yield plant(- 1)(29 and 44%, respectively), and increased thylakoid membrane damage (61 and 68%, respectively) compared to their respective control (OT). HT stress during anthesis or grain filling stage increased the molar percentage of less unsaturated lipid species [36:5- monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG)]. However, at grain filling stage, HT stress decreased the molar percentage of more unsaturated lipid species (36:6- MGDG and DGDG). There was a significant positive relationship between photosynthetic rate and grain yield plant(- 1), and a negative relationship between thylakoid membrane damage and photosynthetic rate. Conclusions The study suggests that maintaining thylakoid membrane stability, and seed-set per cent and individual grain weight under HT stress can improve the photosynthetic rate and grain yield, respectively.

AB  - The rising global temperatures have posed challenges to human survival and well-being in various regions worldwide. However, little is known about human thermal stress exposure changes among populations living in extreme poverty and struggling to meet their basic needs. This study aimed to investigate the spatial patterns of changes in human thermal stress levels in South Asia using the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI). ERA5 HEAT data from 1979 to 2021 were analyzed using Sen's slope method and the Modified Mann-Kendall test to determine the changes in annual and seasonal thermal stress levels. The findings revealed that Bangladesh, located in the eastern part of South Asia, experiences the highest mean UTCI range (26 to 32 degrees C), while Afghanistan has the lowest among the South Asian nations. In contrast, the western part of South Asia, partic-ularly the region bordering India and Pakistan, exhibits the highest daily maximum UTCI range (38 to 46 degrees C). Trend analysis indicated an increase in mean and maximum UTCI levels across the western part of South Asia, including Pakistan, Afghanistan, and northwest India, at 0.25 to 0.75 degrees C/decade. This increase was more widespread during the June-September (JAS) period than in other seasons. In many regions of the study area, moderate and high thermal stress days increased by 4 to 8 days per decade. As a result, 27.6% of the area shifted from an average comfortable temperature to moderate thermal stress and 18.7% from moderate to strong thermal stress during JAS.

AB  - Climate change and anthropogenic activities are affecting the entire earth, where urban areas are not an exception, being affected by extreme weather conditions and environmental disturbances. Urban expansion and industrial development have negatively affected the local climatic condition due to green space deficiency, soil moisture loss, soil erosion, land subsidence, high runoff, and low infiltration rate. Megacities are needed proper management and awareness for healthy ecosystem. The study investigated the properties of land alteration on the urban heat island (UHI) in the city of Seville, Spain. Earth observational Landsat 5 TM and 8 OLI/TIRS remote sensing datasets were used for generating the urban expansion and related land alteration. The study results indicate that built-up land increased by 139.2 Km(2) while agricultural land decreased by 104.07 Km(2). Open space and plantation areas also decreased by 62.33 Km(2) and 30.76 Km(2), respectively. The average temperature increase was around 0.13 degrees C per year between 1991 and 2021. Megacities need appropriate development, design, and supervision for sustainable urban development to avoid further UHI intensification. UHI map indicates that thermal variation increased from 2.21 degrees C (1991) to 3.42 degrees C (2021). The ecological disturbances also identified using UTFVI and the maps denoted that UTFVI values increased by 0.005 from 1991 to 2021. The present study outcomes are obliging for planners, researchers, and other participants for future evidence-based disaster planning and management.

AB  - This study investigated the environmental burdens concerning the recycling/recovery process of a wastewater treatment plant's construction material waste and biogas. Detailed data inventories of case studies were employed in several scenarios to explore the role of end-of-life treatment methods. The ReCiPe 2016 and the Greenhouse gas Protocol life cycle impact methods were conducted to measure the impact categories. The construction and demolition phases were considered for recycling potential assessment, while the operational phase was examined for assessing the advantages of energy recovery. Metal and concrete recycling show environmental benefits. Increasing the reprocessing rate requires more water consumption but results in: firstly, a decrease of 18.8% in total damage; secondly, reduces problematic mineral scarcity by 3.9%; and thirdly, a shortfall in fossil fuels amounting to 11.6%. Recycling concrete helps to reduce the amount of GHG emissions 1.4-fold. Different biogas treatment methods contribute to various outcomes. Biogas utilization for on-site energy purposes has more advantages than flaring and offsite consumption. Electricity and heat generation originating from biogas can provide 70% of the energy requirement and replace 100% natural gas usage. Biomethane production from biogas requires extreme power and more resources. Meanwhile, producing heat and electricity can offset 102.9 g of fossil CO2, and manufacturing biomethane contributes the equivalent of 101.2 g of fossil fuel-derived CO2. Reducing 10% of recovered electricity creation could rise 19.19% global warming indicator of the waste water treatment plant. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Extreme conditions (high ambient temperature and crosswind speed) reduce the cooling efficiency of dry cooling towers, consequently impairing the thermal performance of thermal power units (TPUs). Phase -change material thermal storage equipment (PCMTSE) is integrated into an indirect dry -cooling system of the TPU to realize a partial cooling load of the cooling tower, thereby stabilizing and improving the thermal performance of the TPU. A model of the TPU and numerical model of the hybrid indirect dry -cooling system are established and coupled, with the inlet cooling water temperature of the condenser serving as the iterative criterion. Two integration schemes are proposed, one with the PCMTSE downstream (Scheme A) and the other with it upstream (Scheme B) of the dry cooling tower. The results show that Scheme A is recommended owing to its superior efficiency in terms of coal savings. The effects of the unit power load on the coal -savings efficiency of the PCMTSE during its charging and discharging processes have been revealed. Operating the PCMTSE at higher power loads aids in improving the thermal efficiency of the TPU during the PCMTSE charging and discharging processes. The charging process should be started at the "three high" working conditions: a high ambient temperature, crosswind speed, and unit power load. The working conditions that allow only one cooling water pump to operate should first be considered for the discharging process, and the "three high" working conditions should then be selected. The TPU equipped with the PCMTSE can save 11.42 tons and 12.74 tons of coal in two typical extreme daily conditions with the implementation of the proposed operating strategy.

AB  - Heat Shock Protein 70 (HSP70) induction helps alleviate the adverse effects of several types of stress in the cells. It can also play a significant role in sperm protection and survival during the extreme conditions of the semen cryopreservation process. The present study was conducted to investigate the role of this protein in spermatozoa of water buffalo by analyzing the changes in its gene expression, protein induction, and distribution after cryopreservation. Differences in HSP70 mRNA and protein levels between fresh and frozen semen samples were determined through real-time PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. Cellular localization patterns of HSP70 in the different sample groups were then detected in an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Lastly, the average sperm motilities of the semen sample groups were evaluated and compared. Results showed that the HSP70 mRNA expression decreased by fifty percent (P<0.05) while the protein level significantly rose by sixty percent (P<0.05) in the frozen sample group. The localization of HSP70 protein in the sperm head also shifted from the equatorial segment in the fresh sample group to the post-acrosomal region in frozen semen samples. Moreover, the average sperm motility appeared to fluctuate with the mRNA level and comparably decreased by fifty percent (P<0.05) in the frozen sample group. These changes on the HSP70 in spermatozoa exhibited the adverse effects of the underlying capacitation-like event in the cryopreservation process. Overall, these findings presented a valuable insight into the current buffalo semen cryopreservation technique and a potential approach to its improvement.

AB  - Background Hot spring biofilms provide a window into the survival strategies of microbial communities in extreme environments and offer potential for biotechnological applications. This study focused on green and brown biofilms thriving on submerged plant litter within the Sungai Klah hot spring in Malaysia, characterised by temperatures of 58-74 degrees C. Using Illumina shotgun metagenomics and Nanopore ligation sequencing, we investigated the microbial diversity and functional potential of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) with specific focus on biofilm formation, heat stress response, and carbohydrate catabolism.Results Leveraging the power of both Illumina short-reads and Nanopore long-reads, we employed an Illumina-Nanopore hybrid assembly approach to construct MAGs with enhanced quality. The dereplication process, facilitated by the dRep tool, validated the efficiency of the hybrid assembly, yielding MAGs that reflected the intricate microbial diversity of these extreme ecosystems. The comprehensive analysis of these MAGs uncovered intriguing insights into the survival strategies of thermophilic taxa in the hot spring biofilms. Moreover, we examined the plant litter degradation potential within the biofilms, shedding light on the participation of diverse microbial taxa in the breakdown of starch, cellulose, and hemicellulose. We highlight that Chloroflexota and Armatimonadota MAGs exhibited a wide array of glycosyl hydrolases targeting various carbohydrate substrates, underscoring their metabolic versatility in utilisation of carbohydrates at elevated temperatures.Conclusions This study advances understanding of microbial ecology on plant litter under elevated temperature by revealing the functional adaptation of MAGs from hot spring biofilms. In addition, our findings highlight potential for biotechnology application through identification of thermophilic lignocellulose-degrading enzymes. By demonstrating the efficiency of hybrid assembly utilising Illumina-Nanopore reads, we highlight the value of combining multiple sequencing methods for a more thorough exploration of complex microbial communities.

AB  - With the substantial improvement of the direct ammonia fuel cells performance, it has become the key to the further development of ammonia fuel cells to deeply understand the heat and mass transfer process inside the cell and to study the thermal impacts generation mechanism during cell operation. In this paper, a whole-cell model of single tubular direct ammonia cracking solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is established, and the generation mecha-nism of thermal impacts inside the cell is analysed in a data-driven method. The model includes the coupling of chemical-electrochemical reactions, local current, local temper-ature, mass flow and energy transfer inside the cell. It's identified from model simulations that the key to the thermal impact optimization of direct ammonia cracking SOFCs is to reduce the effect of the excessively fast and unbalanced ammonia cracking reaction on the cell. Both introducing the ammonia pre-reforming reaction and improving the activation energy of the ammonia cracking reaction can increase the overall average temperature of the cell and improve the temperature distribution. The 96% ammonia pre-reforming SOFCs can improve the extreme temperature difference in the anode from 37.71 K to 0.52 K at the operating temperature of 800 degrees C. Increasing activation energy of ammonia cracking reac-tion by 1.5 times can also make the ammonia cracking reaction rate distribution more uniform at the fuel channel, it can improve the extreme temperature difference in the anode to 4.49 K. This study can enrich the basic theory and research methods of thermal management of direct ammonia cracking SOFCs, and provide theoretical support for further improving cell performance.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB  - Public health is threatened by climate change and extreme temperature events worldwide. Differences in health predispositions, access to cooling infrastructure and occupation raises an issue of heat-related health inequality in those vulnerable and disadvantaged demographic groups. To address these issues, a comprehensive understanding of the effect of elevated body temperatures on human biological systems and overall health is urgently needed. In this paper we look at the inner workings of the human innate immunity under exposure to heat stress induced through exposure to environment and physical exertion. We couple two experimentally validated computational models: the innate immune system and thermal regulation of the human body. We first study the dynamics of critical indicators of innate immunity as a function of human core temperature. Next, we identify environmental and physical activity regimes that lead to core temperature levels that can potentially compromise the performance of the human innate immunity. Finally, to take into account the response of innate immunity to various intensities of physical activities, we utilise the dynamic core temperatures generated by a thermal regulation model. We compare the dynamics of all key players of the innate immunity for a variety of stresses like running a marathon, doing construction work, and leisure walking at speed of 4 km/h, all in the setting of a hot and humid tropical climate such as present in Singapore. We find that exposure to moderate heat stress leading to core temperatures within the mild febrile range (37, 38]degrees C, nudges the innate immune system into activation and improves the efficiency of its response. Overheating corresponding to core temperatures beyond 38 degrees C, however, has detrimental effects on the performance of the innate immune system, as it further induces inflammation, which causes a series of reactions that may lead to the non-resolution of the ongoing inflammation. Among the three physical activities considered in our simulated scenarios (marathon, construction work, and walking), marathon induces the highest level of inflammation that challenges the innate immune response with its resolution. Our study advances the current state of research towards understanding the implications of heat exposure for such an essential physiological system as the innate immunity. Although we find that among considered physical activities, a marathon of 2 h and 46 min induces the highest level of inflammation, it must be noted that construction work done on a daily basis under the hot and humid tropical climate, can produce a continuous level of inflammation triggering moieties stretched at a longer timeline beating the negative effects of running a marathon. Our study demonstrates that the performance of the innate immune system can be severely compromised by the exposure to heat stress and physical exertion. This poses significant risks to health especially to those with limited access to cooling infrastructures. This is due in part to having low income, or having to work on outdoor settings, which is the case for construction workers. These risks to public health should be addressed through individual and population-level measures via behavioural adaptation and provision of the cooling infrastructure in outdoor environments.

AB  - Surface plasmon resonance excitation significantly enhancestheabsorption of light and increases the generation of "hot"electrons, i.e., conducting electrons that are raised from their steadystates to excited states. These excited electrons rapidly decay andequilibrate via radiative and nonradiative damping over several hundredfemtoseconds. During the hot-electron dynamics, from their generationto the ultimate nonradiative decay, the electromagnetic field enhancement,hot electron density increase, and local heating effect are sequentiallyinduced. Over the past decade, these physical phenomena have attractedconsiderable attention in the biomedical field, e.g., the rapid andaccurate identification of biomolecules, precise synthesis and releaseof drugs, and elimination of tumors. This review highlights the recentdevelopments in the application of hot-electron dynamics in medicaldiagnosis and therapy, particularly fully integrated device techniqueswith good application prospects. In addition, we discuss the latestexperimental and theoretical studies of underlying mechanisms. Froma practical standpoint, the pioneering modeling analyses and quantitativemeasurements in the extreme near field are summarized to illustratethe quantification of hot-electron dynamics. Finally, the prospectsand remaining challenges associated with biomedical engineering basedon hot-electron dynamics are presented.

AB  - Epoxy decays its dielectric characteristics and exhibits degradation of main hydrocarbon on exposure to multiple environmental stresses. Inorganic oxides-based epoxy composites have been performingwell in many applications and short-term testing; therefore, evaluation of their dielectric and structural characteristics under extreme weathering conditions may also unleash enhancement in these characteristics. To explore dielectric properties and degradation of main hydrocarbon group, neat epoxy and silica-based epoxy microcomposite (15% micro-silica loading) and nanocomposites (5% nano-silica loading)have been prepared and subjected to acid rain, heat, ultra-violet radiation, salt fog, and humidity in a chamber that was specially fabricated in view ofservice conditions. Interesting results were obtained before and after aging. Enhanced intactness of methylene group was observed in nanocomposite followed by micro composite. Similarly, for epoxy nanocomposites not only higher dielectric constant, lower energy dissipation and conductivity was recorded before application of stresses, but also nanocomposite showed superior sustainability in these properties after aging. In all analyses, microcomposites performed better than neat epoxy but in conductivity the results of both samples were found comparable.

AB  - Traditional ceramic materials are generally brittle and not flexible with high production costs, which seriously hinders their practical applications. Multifunctional nanofiber ceramic aerogels are highly desirable for applications in extreme environments, however, the integration of multiple functions in their preparation is extremely challenging. To tackle these challenges, we fabricated a multifunctional SiC@SiO2 nanofiber aerogel (SiC@SiO2 NFA) with a three-dimensional (3D) porous cross-linked structure through a simple chemical vapor deposition method and subsequent heat-treatment process. The as-prepared SiC@SiO2 NFA exhibits an ultralow density (similar to 11 mg cm(- 3)), ultra-elastic, fatigue-resistant and refractory performance, high temperature thermal stability, thermal insulation properties, and significant strain-dependent piezoresistive sensing behavior. Furthermore, the SiC@SiO2 NFA shows a superior electromagnetic wave absorption performance with a minimum refection loss (RLmin) value of - 50.36 dB and a maximum effective absorption bandwidth (EAB(max)) of 8.6 GHz. The successful preparation of this multifunctional aerogel material provides a promising prospect for the design and fabrication of the cutting-edge ceramic materials.

AB  - A global interest in Silver Barb (Barbonymus gonionotus) cultivation has arisen because of a combination of declining wild stock and a steady increase in demand and market value. The purpose of the current investigation was to evaluate the impact of extreme water temperature changes on growth, hemato-biochemical responses, pepsin enzyme activity and gill histomorphology of B. gonionotus. Four distinct temperatures (22, 26, 30 and 34 degrees C) were applied in the laboratory (22, 26, 30 and 34 degrees C) in triplicate glass aquariums (150 L each). At 30 and 22 degrees C, respectively, the highest and the lowest length and weight gain, specific, daily and relative growth rates were noted. At 30 degrees C the lowest FCR was recorded (1.42 +/- 0.04). The values related to hematology and biochemistry were found to be within normal ranges; nevertheless, there was a notable variation in the parameters when the temperature changed. Hematological results revealed that RBC, HB, PLT, HCT and PMV levels were significantly higher in groups 30 degrees C with respect to others. It was evident that cold and heat shock stress was present due to the decline in hematocrit levels and rise in WBC values. Regarding the biochemical responses, the level of triglycerides, cholesterol, AP, Ca+, HDL, and HDL/LDL ratio increased significantly higher at 30 degrees C. Glucose, total protein, albumin, Na+, K+, Cl-1, AST, bilirubin, uric acid, and LDL levels were significantly higher at 22 degrees C compared to other temperatures. There was a higher pepsin activity between 26 and 30 degrees C while the digestive somatic index (I-DS) was disproportionate. Histological examination demonstrated the well-shaped gill tissues at 26 and 30 degrees C compared to distinctive pathology in other temperature treatments. As an end note, the results of the experiment indicated that B. gonionotus should be cultured at 26-30 degrees C to maximize the overall productivity and the health condition of this economically important fish species.

AB  - Shallow reefs are a major feature of coral assemblages in the Andaman Sea. At Phuket, Thailand sheltered reefs are dominated by massive corals, together with an increasing abundance of branching species during favourable growth conditions. The growth of coral on these reefs is moderated by long-term increases in sea temperature and relative sea level but fluctuating decadal/intradecadal climate processes of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), which modulate sea level and temperature, are the main drivers of coral cover. In this study, the contribution of these two climate processes was identified and also quantified. Over a 34-year study of fluctuating coral cover, the three major reductions in cover in 1997, 2010 and 2019 were linked to overlapping positive IOD (pIOD) and El Ninos in 1997 and 2019, and with an El Nino alone in 2010. Combined pIOD and El Nino depressed sea level was the major factor in reducing cover in 1997 while El Nino extreme sea temperatures were responsible for large reductions in 2010. In 2019, a bi-phasic pIOD and El Nino resulted in lowered cover at a time of both decreased sea level and high sea temperature. Under global warming scenarios, it is projected that extreme pIODs, such as those seen in 1997 and 2019, will occur more frequently while El Nino frequencies will continue to increase even after global mean temperature stabilization. In these circumstances, and with steadily rising background sea temperatures, the future risks to the shallow reefs of the Andaman Sea are substantial, despite any temporary respite gained from climate related or land subsidence sea-level rise. Such findings have wider implications for all reefs affected by climatic-driven sea-level depressions, particularly those around Indonesian shores where similar El-Nino-related reductions in coral cover have been reported.

AB  - Extreme events like floods, tsunamis, hurricanes, etc., can threaten the normal operation of district power and thermal networks in multi-energy distribution systems (MDSs). Exploiting the reconfigurable properties of the combined network can provide a cost-effective solution to enhance the MDS resilience level and operation flexibility by redistributing multi-energy loads. In this paper, a resilient restoration approach is proposed for a MDS to coordinate multi-stage dispatch decisions in a distributed manner. First, the MDS operation is modelled with the power and thermal network constraints. As the district thermal network model is nonlinear, massive auxiliary flow variables are introduced to make the reconfiguration problem tractable, which significantly reduces the computational burdens. Second, to handle diverse uncertainties from the outcomes of disasters, loads, and renewable generation, both the pre-restoration and real-time stage measures are coordinated via a two-stage stochastic programming method. To further save the solution time, a distributed algorithm named progress hedging is used to decompose the original large problem into several small sub-ones. At last, case studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to other traditional restoration benchmarks.

AB  - In the proton exchange membrane fuel cells, the bipolar plates (BPs) are being widely used in multifunctional mode. They have many unique properties, including prevention of coolant and gas leakages, dissipation of heat from active portions, distribution of air, gas, and fuel uniformly, electric current conduction between cell to cell as a chain, etc. This experimental work was intense to fabricate polymer-based composite bipolar plates using hybrid combinations. Composites are prepared by using carbon black (CB), glass fiber (GF), and graphite (G) with epoxy and silicone resins. The mixing of composite materials with resins is controlled by the Aquila Taguchi optimization (ATO) method through the L16 Orthogonal Array (OA). Mixing parameters are chosen as rotational speed (20, 30, 40, and 50 rpm), mixing time (10, 15, 20, and 25 min), and mixing temperature (25, 30, 35, and 40 degrees C). Influencing these parameters increases the electrical conductivity (S/cm) and flexural strength (MPa) of the newly prepared bipolar plate composites. From this analysis, highest electrical conductivity is obtained, such as 268.361 S/cm. Similarly, extreme flexural strength occurred at 134.90 MPa.

AB  - Climate change is a crucial cause of health issues, as reported in many studies. Temperature is one of the important factors related to extreme weather. Chiang Mai, the center of the north of Thailand, is also affected by temperature changes that have led to many outpatient visits. Better information will help the health service to be well-prepared. This research applied typical meteorological data and solar radiation into the distributed lag nonlinear model and a quasi-Poisson regression model. The "hot effect" and "cold effect" on outpatient visits caused by respiratory diseases, dermatophytosis, and intestinal infectious diseases in a public Chiang Mai hospital between January 2015 and December 2019 were then investigated. Of the 185,202 cases, results showed that all of the diseases mentioned had more than 10% of relative risk (RR) in cold effects. However, the RR of dermatophytosis was found to be 114%, a very high risk. In the case of hot effects, the patients of the age 19-29 have relatively high RR over 20% for respiratory diseases and dermatophytosis. It was also observed that cold effects lasted longer than hot effects.

AB  - Myanmar's territory mostly experiences tropical monsoon climate, where temperatures are normally not extreme, but humidity can increase discomfort. In response, vernacular architecture strategies have evolved to deal with excess heat and humidity. One of the most prominent of these strategies is the use of high multistage roofs with ventilation. Over the years, many of the traditional buildings were altered but the use of multistage roof design has remained remarkably resilient in Myanmar. Nevertheless, little is known about their contribution to thermal comfort and their vulnerability to overheating risks due to the pervasive threat of the climate crisis.
   In the work presented here, a thorough review of multistage roof typologies was followed by an investigation of their performance when building parameters including form, ventilation and materials were varied. Twentyfour dynamic simulations were performed using three building typologies and thirty-two computational fluid dynamic simulations were performed using two building typologies. In all cases, indoor volumes were kept the same. The results suggest that with the use of a typical light-weight permeable envelope, the indoor temperatures follow outdoor ambient temperature closely; although a heavier-weight set of materials did not impact significantly on the maximum air temperatures, it has made a different with regard to the lowest temperatures and overall comfort. The variable that impacted the most on the results was roof ventilation mode, with the best results being 3.5 % of a year better than the worst. The multistage roof was found to help reduce heat gains form solar radiation.
   The findings showed that Myanmar's vernacular buildings with multistage roofs offer an opportunity to improve indoor comfort in tropical climates and therefore its ability to moderate indoor temperatures through the use of simple building physics and geometry should be honoured.

AB  - Extreme temperatures have become a threat to crop yields. To maintain plant growth and yield, chlorophyll (Chl) biosynthesis plays a crucial role in adaptation to temperature stress. This study investigated the influence of temperature on the biosynthesis and characteristics of pigments (Chl a, Chl b, and carotenoids) in the leaves of Chl b-lacking mutant rice (Chlorina 1, ch1) and wild-type rice (Norin No.8, wt). The ch1 showed thinner stacked grana caused by a decrease in thylakoid membranes per granum at 15 degrees C, whereas the destacked grana were observed at 35 degrees C after 12 h incubation. However, the grana are stacked normally, along with the absence of Chl b, and a significantly decreased amount of Chl a in both wtand ch1 were observed after heat stress exposure, demonstrating that light-harvesting complex II proteins are involved in grana stacking. Ch1 was sensitive to 15 degrees C during the first 4 h of incubation but it subsequently adapted to the cold environment. In addition, there were no significant differences in the photosynthesis between wtand ch1 after 12 h incubation at 35 degrees C. Differentially expressed gene (DEGs) analysis revealed that GluRS expression decreased, which resulted in a decline in Chl biosynthesis in wtand ch1 at 35 degrees C. At 8 h and 12 h, there were no significant differences in the expression of DEGs involved in Chl biosynthesis and degradation between wt and ch1 at 15 degrees C. ALAD expression in wtand ch1 at 15 degrees C decreased until it was undetectable. These findings suggested that ch1 may adapt to temperatures ranging from 15 degrees C to 35 degrees C.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of lignocellulosic biomass has gained attention as a promising technology for the production of biofuels and other value-added products. HTL process optimization is complex and involves various parameters such as reaction time, temperature, and pressure. In recent years, machine learning (ML) approaches have been adopted as a tool to optimize and predict the HTL process performance. The purposes of this study were to investigate the ML-based prediction of bio-crude yield (BCY) and their higher heating values (HHVs) from HTL of lignocellulosic biomass and to elucidate the relationship of features affecting the output of interest. Pre-processing and normalization were applied to a dataset of 215 data points with 17 input features. Feature selection using the Shapley value method identified key predictors. ML models including multilayer perceptron, kernel ridge regression, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) were trained and evaluated. XGB algorithm shows superior performance in predicting the yields and their calorific values to within 5-8% of experimental values. Temperature was the most influential feature for both BCY and HHV prediction accounting for about 30%, followed by other feedstock and operational characteristics. In addition, a user interface was presented for ease of use in the ML modeling.

AB  - This study evaluated the relationship between crystallite size and micromechanical characteristics of micrometer-sized monoclinic WO3 particles. To avoid the existence of other parameters in the measurement (such as impurities and porous structure in the particle), micrometer WO3 particles were prepared using a direct heat treatment of ultrapure micrometer-sized ammonium tungstate powders. The crystallite size was controlled independently in constant WO3 particle outer diameters to obtain a precise measurement result. The mechanical properties, i.e., hardness and Young's modulus, were measured by load-controlled nanoindentation test on the singular WO3 particles. The force and displacement relationship data was plotted and analyzed to obtain the relationship between crystallite size and mechanical properties. The results revealed that the micromechanical properties of WO3 particles were strongly dependent on the crystallite size. The hardness and Young's modulus values increased more than three times when increasing the crystallite size to about 40 nm. The study was completed with a proposed mechanism of crack propagation inside the particle due to static load. The study demonstrates the important role of crystallite size in determining the micromechanical characteristics of WO3 particles. The result is useful especially when utilizing WO3 microparticles for various processes involving extreme conditions, such as high pressure reaction.

AB  - Climate change refers to the increase of earth's temperature. It results to catastrophic disasters such as floods, heavy rains, tsunamis, storm surge, and extreme heat. The events produces property destruction, loss of crops, landslides, melting of ice and many more. Most of the disasters stated are water-related, that parameters such as water level and water flow are the primary factors of such phenomena, so this study developed a smart environment network that monitors the rise of water level and water flow. The system utilized a Zigbee protocol (802.15.4) for the transmission of the signal from the Base Station to other nodes. Bluetooth technology was used for the access of the users to the network. A localized water level sensor was utilized with the help of an operational amplifier and together with the water flow sensor. The system underwent evaluation tests such as functionality test and reliability test for three days. Analysis of the results showed that the system functions as expected. It indicates that the study was reliable for detecting water level and water flow reading especially on the transmission of data even if there were no electric power, no internet connection and no cellphone signal.

AB  - Polymer gears have great potential in motion and power transmission since they offer many advantages over conventional metal gears. However, the use of polymer gears in industrial applications has been limited due to inadequate information with respect to their performance and designs. In this research work, our goal was to study and analyze the characteristics of a polymer gear produced from polylactic acid through the a three-dimensional (3D) printing process. Experiments involving polymer test gears were carried out on a test rig at three rotational speeds. The parameters studied during the investigation were the infill percentage, rotational speed, and load attendance. Four types of failure characteristics-namely, the formation of debris, micro-surface condition monitoring, weight loss, and thermal damage-were analyzed in the experiments. The investigation showed that the weight reduction wear rate was related to the development of debris and the condition of the gear. The test gear wear rate from the weight reduction through material scratching and breakage increased progressively under extreme wear conditions. Further thermal analysis and microstructure observations also revealed the impact of temperature from frictional heat on the amount of wear on the polymer gear. The higher the operating temperature, the higher was the amount of wear seen in the polymer gear.

AB  - Oil palm crop yield is sensitive to heat and drought. Therefore, El Nino events affect oil palm production, resulting in price fluctuations of crude palm oil due to global supply shortage. This study developed a new Fresh Fruit Bunch Index (FFBI) model based on the monthly oil palm fresh fruit bunch (FFB) yield data, which correlates directly with the Oceanic Nino Index (ONI) to model the impact of past El Nino events in Malaysia in terms of production and economic losses. FFBI is derived from Malaysian monthly FFB yields from January 1986 to July 2021 in the same way ONI is derived from monthly sea surface temperatures (SST). With FFBI model, the Malaysian oil palm yields are better correlated with ONI and have higher predictive ability. The descriptive and inferential statistical assessments show that the newly proposed FFBI time series model (adjusted R-squared = 0.9312 and residual median = 0.0051) has a better monthly oil palm yield predictive ability than the FFB model (adjusted R-squared = 0.8274 and residual median = 0.0077). The FFBI model also revealed an oil palm under yield concern of the Malaysian oil palm industry in the next thirty-month forecasted period from July 2021 to December 2023.

AB  - The production of freshwater represents a prominent global challenge nowadays. One eco-friendly technology to provide clean water even in an adverse environment, with extreme temperatures and scarce groundwater resources is solar-driven water evaporation or solar-to-steam generation. Besides, freshwater can be also extracted from polluted soil or water, purifying the water in the process at the same time. The champion solar-driven water evaporation efficiency is achieved at over 100%. The advancements in photothermal evaporation predominantly prioritize material modification and interfacial heating, with a significant emphasis on optimizing vapor generation efficiency, often neglecting the practical aspect of water collection. By using the right materials, the system can be cost-effective and have a low environmental impact. In this progress report, the latest advancements in natural materials, carbonization of natural materials, hybrid natural materials, and nature-inspired materials are presented. We will delve into their effectiveness in evaporation and their energy efficiency. The review provides suggestions about the compatibility of natural materials for this application and reports on insights into the advancements already accomplished, as well as the remaining opportunities for enhancing the performance of these cost-effective, environmentally friendly, high-performance systems.

TI  - Toward better understanding of the high-pressure structural transformation in beryllium by the statistical moment method
T2  - PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
LA  - English
AB  - Beryllium is a vital alkaline-earth metal for plasma physics, space science, and nuclear technology. Unfortunately, its accurate phase diagram is clouded by many controversial results, even though solid beryllium can only exist with hcp or bcc crystalline structures. Herein, we offer a simple quantum-statistical solution to the above problem. Our core idea is to develop the moment expansion technique to determine the Helmholtz free energy under extreme conditions. This strategy helps elucidate the underlying correlation among symmetric characteristics, vibrational excitations, and physical stabilities. In particular, our analyses reveal that the appearance of anharmonic effects forcefully straightens up the hcp-bcc boundary. This phenomenon explains why it has been difficult to detect bcc signatures via diamond-anvil-cell measurements. Besides, we modify the work-heat equivalence principle to quickly obtain the high-pressure melting profile from the room-temperature equation of state. The hcp-bcc-liquid triple point of beryllium is found at 165 GPa and 4559 K. Our theoretical findings agree excellently with cutting-edge ab initio simulations adopting the phonon quasiparticle method and the thermodynamic integration. Finally, we consider the principal Hugoniot curve and its secondary branches to explore the behaviors of beryllium under shock compression. Our predictions would be advantageous for designing inertial-confinement-fusion experiments.

AB  - Current plant-based foods use plant proteins as a key structuring and texturing ingredient. The use of water for extraction can replace conventional protein extraction methods. Water extraction of protein is environmentally friendly and could prevent the loss of protein functionality due to extreme pH changes. This study demonstrates an aqueous extraction method, coupled with ultrasound as pre-treatment, to obtain buckwheat protein (BWPE) and assess its gelling property and composited gel with kappa-carrageenan (k-carr). Textural and rheological analyses showed that the hardness and storage modulus of the composited gel containing 1 % w/w BWPE and 1 % w/w k-carr was 4.2-fold and 100-fold, respectively, higher than k-carr gel at 1 % w/w. Light microscopy showed a mixed bi-continuous gel system, with k-carr reinforcing the protein gel network. Besides volume exclusion effects, chemical bond and FTIR analyses revealed that adding k-carr to BWPE altered the protein's secondary structure and mediated protein denaturation during heating. This results in greater beta-sheet content, which creates a more organised gel structure. These results demonstrated that ultrasound-assisted waterextracted BWPE, together with varying concentrations of k-carr, can be used to develop composited gels of tailorable textural and rheological properties to suit different food applications.

AB  - Low melting point and material adhesion are associated challenges of magnesium alloy, leading to extreme built-up edge (BUE) and built-up layer (BUL) formations during machining process. Dry machining is favorable for machining magnesium alloy. However, this strategy inflicts excessive adhesive wear on the cutting tool. Therefore, this current work focuses on application of an innovative cooling technique, known as submerged convective cooling (SCC) for the turning of AZ31 magnesium alloy. Prior to cutting experiment, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation was conducted to evaluate internal structure of cooling module. Based on the CFD simulation, a small inlet/outlet diameter of 3 mm significantly contributed to the reduction of the tool temperature, due to high heat transfer coefficient of cooling fluid in the SCC. From the experimental results obtained, it was evident that SCC at high cooling water flow rate of 130 mL/min effectively reduced the tool temperature, chip temperature, and tool-chip contact length by approximately 50, 8, and 28%, respectively. Consequently, it improved the surface roughness by 37%, when compared with the dry cutting condition. Finally, both BUE and BUL were observed in dry and SCC conditions, but the severity of these wear mechanisms improved or decreased remarkably under SCC conditions.

AB  - In this research, the principal purpose is investigating the performance of structural elements significantly degrades at elevated temperatures. Steel-concrete composite floor systems are one of the most relevant components in building construction in which fire-induced problems directly damage their performance. The purpose of this study is on employing analytical intelligence technique to predict two major structural characteristics of the steel-concrete composite floor system. Two intelligent methods, ELM-PSO and ELM-GWO, were used as a multi-combination AI method to predict the shear and tensile response of these composite floor systems at high temperature. Accordingly, authenticated data on monotonic loading response of this steel-concrete composite floor system in different heat stages had been employed from different literatures. The results show that ELM-GWO technique presented the best prediction of split-tensile load, and the ELM-GWO provided the best estimation of slip value. By giving each prediction equations, the best equations were proposed. As a result, employing ELM-GWO, successfully presented reliable and decisive results and proved the proficiency of the techniques.

AB  - Bismaleimide (BMI) resin holds great significance to the aerospace field, however, the limited toughness and inadequate fire resistance impede its broader application area. The addition of carbon fiber (CF) can enhance the toughness of BMI resin, but fire safety and interfacial stability between CF and BMI matrix need to be further considered. Here, the carbon fiber-reinforced BMI resin laminate was designed to improve fire resistance, mechanical properties, and interfacial affinity based on a novel P, N, and Si surface-modified flame retardant (MX@HBET) and silane-modified CF. Upon addition of 1 wt% MX@HBET to BMI/CF composites, the total heat release and total smoke production respectively exhibited 10.73 % and 33.3 % reduction. Furthermore, the laminate exhibited significant fire resistance when exposed to butane flame (1500 degrees C) and the backplane temperature was maintained at approximately 430 degrees C for 20 min. In addition, the impact and tensile strengths of the laminate respectively reached 82.10 kJ/m 2 and 466.6 MPa (pure BMI/CF corresponding to 63.52 kJ/m 2 and 350.1 MPa). In brief, the flame resistance and mechanical performance enhanced greatly via the introduction of modified MXene and CF, providing promising prospects for the application of aviation materials in extreme conditions.

AB  - The present-day ubiquity of smart devices used under extreme conditions demands robust and more sustainable energy storage. Therefore, lightweight electrodes with both excellent electrochemical and mechanical performance to meet these needs are of great importance. Moreover, the recycling of current energy storage devices poses significant environmental concerns, a particularly daunting prospect given the increasing waste volume of metal-based electrodes. To that end, these challenges of performance and sustainability are addressed by leveraging accessible digital light processing (DLP) technology and tailored post-process heat treatment to fabricate a metal-based 3D substrate with ultrahigh precision and hierarchical porosity. Here, a 4-mm-thickness metal-based electrode with NiCo2S4 loading of 18.38 mg cm(-2) achieves a high areal capacity of 7.327 mA h cm(-2) at 44.85 mA cm(-2), providing a promising way to fabricate high-performance thick electrodes. Most importantly, these electrodes can be fabricated from recyclable metal salt feedstock. The geometric freedom offered by 3D printing supplemented by finite element analyses allows for optimized complex structures to be fabricated. Through rational design realized by 3D printing, a desirable compromise between building density, mechanical properties, electrochemical performances, and environment-friendly processing cycle can be arrived upon.

AB  - This study describes the creation of a new type of compact skin-like silicone-based thermosensitive visuotactile sensor based on GelSight technology. The easy integration of this novel sensor into a complex visuotactile system capable of very rapid detection of temperature change (30 degrees C/s) is unique in providing a system that parallels the withdrawal reflex of the human autonomic system to extreme heat. To the best of authors' awareness, this is the first time a sensor that can trigger a sensory impulse like a withdrawal reflex of humans in robotics community. To attain this, we used thermochromic pigments color blue, orange, and black with a threshold of 31 degrees C, 43 degrees C, and 50 degrees C, respectively on the gel material. Each pigment has the property of becoming translucent when its temperature threshold is reached, making it possible to stack thermochromic pigments of different colors and thresholds. The pigments were air-brushed on a low-cost commercially available transparent silicone sponge. We used MobileNetV2 and transfer learning to simulate tactile preprocessing in order to recognize five different objects. The new thermosensitive visuotactile sensor helped to achieve 97.3% tactile image classification accuracy of five different objects. Our novel thermosensitive visuotactile sensor could be of benefit in material texture analysis, telerobotics, space exploration, and medical applications.

AB  - Weed management in large-scale solar photovoltaic (LSS-PV) farms has become a great concern to the solar industry due to scarcity of labour and the ever-increasing price of pesticides, which opens up possibilities for integrated farming, also known as agrivoltaics. Improper weed control may have multiple negative impacts such as permanent shading of the module surface, pest housing which damages communication cables, and even bush fires. The shaded PV modules can be heated up to extreme temperatures, causing costly burn-out damage. Critical information on the types of weeds on solar farms, especially in Malaysia, has not been established to support the concept of weed management. Thus, with this study, detailed composition of the weed community was obtained via quadrat sampling between solar PV modules, near ground equipment, near perimeter fencing, and directly underneath the PV modules. Weed-control measures via high-quality weedmat installation under solar PV arrays have been implemented where this approach can be considered effective on solar farms based on the existing PV structure height and equipment constraints plus the increasing cost for labour and agricultural inputs. This work underlines the proposed Agrivoltaic for Large Scale Solar (Agrivoltaic4LSS) program to complement the solar industry in Malaysia towards an agrivoltaic, eco-friendly approach to weed management.

AB  - Introduction: The oriental fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis is one of the most destructive agricultural pests worldwide, with highly debated species delimitation, origin, and global spread routes.Objectives: Our study intended to (i) resolve the taxonomic uncertainties between B. dorsalis and B. carambolae, (ii) reveal the population structure and global invasion routes of B. dorsalis across Asia, Africa, and Oceania, and (iii) identify genomic regions that are responsible for the thermal adaptation of B. dorsalis.Methods: Based on a high-quality chromosome-level reference genome assembly, we explored the population relationship using a genome-scale single nucleotide polymorphism dataset generated from the resequencing data of 487 B. dorsalis genomes and 25 B. carambolae genomes. Genome-wide association studies and silencing using RNA interference were used to identify and verify the candidate genes associated with extreme thermal stress.Results: We showed that B. dorsalis originates from the Southern India region with three independent invasion and spread routes worldwide: (i) from Northern India to Northern Southeast Asia, then to Southern Southeast Asia; (ii) from Northern India to Northern Southeast Asian, then to China and Hawaii; and (iii) from Southern India toward the African mainland, then to Madagascar, which is mainly facilitated by human activities including trade and immigration. Twenty-seven genes were identified by a genome-wide association study to be associated with 11 temperature bioclimatic variables. The Cyp6a9 gene may enhance the thermal adaptation of B. dorsalis and thus boost its invasion, which tended to be upregulated at a hardening temperature of 38 degrees C. Functional verification using RNA interference silencing against Cyp6a9, led to the specific decrease in Cyp6a9 expression, reducing the survival rate of dsRNA-feeding larvae exposed to extreme thermal stress of 45 degrees C after heat hardening treatments in B. dorsalis.Conclusion: This study provides insights into the evolutionary history and genetic basis of temperature adaptation in B. dorsalis.(c) 2023 The Authors.

AB  - It is very important to maintain the thermal comfort for the residents at outdoor arena, to develop sustainable cities and promote outdoor activities for the residents. Although, there are many passive ways to maintain that thermal comfort at outdoor spaces without using much energy like the design and orientation of the building envelope. Also, adopting passive measures like using shades, and shading of trees, reflectors, shutters, louvers and so forth, help in mitigating the heat in a building. Similarly, humans can adapt to the environment by making changes in their physiological behavior to help combat extreme weathers too, like maintaining healthy habits, diet, posture, use of light clothing and so on, and adapting to the environment. However, in humid and hot areas like Thailand where the weather challenges the residents to extreme, there are ways to maintain the thermal comfort using little energy for the outdoor spaces. Evaporative cooling is one of these options. This study was conducted to analyse the effectiveness of direct evaporative in an open area at Thammasat university, Rangsit campus. We collected the data by installing sensors at the evaporative coolers to analyse how much energy it requires to operate, and its performance and effectiveness by measuring the outdoor temperature and humidity with and without the use of evaporative coolers. The data was recorded from October 31 to November 1, 2019 on hourly basis. This data was tallied with the environmental meteorological data which was measured at Don Mueang international airport station. The type of the evaporative cooling systems installed at the Thammasat university is the jet fan type direct evaporative cooling system (DES) system. It is important to check the effectiveness of evaporative coolers by calculating air enthalpy at different times of the day. This way, we tried to see at what time of the day, at what temperature and at what enthalpy the evaporative coolers are most effective. Moreover, we found out what should be the effective daily duration of evaporative coolers operation. We also calculated the energy offset, that is, the total energy saved using evaporative coolers which could not have been saved, if air conditioners had been used instead.

AB  - Studies regarding the properties of geopolymers with silica fume addition at elevated temperature exposure were rarely reported. This paper evaluates the effect of silica fume inclusion on the flexural and thermal performance of geopolymers based on fly ash (FA) and ladle furnace slag (LFS) with thickness of merely 10 mm. Fly ash/slag (FS) geopolymer was prepared by mixing FA and LFS using a weight ratio of 60:40 with an alkali activator (sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide). Silica fume (1, 2, 3, and 4 wt%) was added to prepare FSF geopolymers. The geopolymers were then subjected to the elevated temperature up to 1100 & DEG;C after 28-days of curing. Higher flexural strength of 9.1 MPa was achieved in unexposed FSF geopolymers with 3 wt% silica fume addition as compared to unexposed FS geopolymers (7.8 MPa). Flexural strength degraded with higher silica fume content of 4 wt%. Heat treatment significantly improved the flexural strength of geopolymers. Both FS and FSF3 geopolymers had increased strength of 208.9% to 24.1 MPa at 1100 & DEG;C and 192.3% to 26.6 MPa at 1000 & DEG;C, respectively as compared to the unexposed specimen. The inclusion of silica fume with extreme fineness improved the interconnectivity of the geopolymer matrix, densifying the geopolymer structure and thus enhancing the thermal resistance of geopolymers. However, the dense matrix with low flowability of FSF3 geopolymers could not sustain the high thermal stress and caused strength degradation and crack formation at a high temperature of 1100 & DEG;C. Even so, the flexural strength of 1100 & DEG;C heat-treated FSF3 geopolymer was 13.2% higher than the unexposed specimen. This demonstrated that silica fume could be incorporated in enhancing the thermal resistance and high strength achievement in geopolymers.

AB  - Climatic fluctuations, temperature extremes, and water scarcity are becoming increasingly unpredictable with the passage of time. Such environmental atrocities have been the scourge of agriculture over the ages, bringing with them poor harvests and threat of famine. Rice production, owing to its high-water requirement for cultivation, is highly vulnerable to the threat of changing climate, particularly prolonged drought and high temperature, individually or in combination. Amidst all the abiotic stresses, heat and drought are considered as the most important concurrent stressors, largely affecting rice yield and productivity under the current scenario. Such threats heighten the need for new breeding and cultivation strategies in generating abiotic stress-resilient rice varieties with better yield potential. Responses of rice to these stresses can be categorized at the morphological, physiological and biochemical levels. This review examines the physiological and molecular mechanism, in the form of up regulation of several defense machineries of rice varieties to cope with drought stress (DS), high temperature stress (HTS), and their combination (DS-HTS). Genotypic differences among rice varieties in their tolerance ability have also been addressed. The review also appraises research studies conducted in rice regarding various phenotypic traits, genetic loci and response mechanisms to stress conditions to help craft new breeding strategies for improved tolerance to DS and HTS, singly or in combination. The review also encompasses the gene regulatory networks and transcription factors, and their cross-talks in mediating tolerance to such stresses. Understanding the epigenetic regulation, involving DNA methylation and histone modification during such hostile situations, will also play a crucial role in our comprehensive understanding of combinatorial stress responses. Taken together, this review consolidates current research and available information on promising rice cultivars with desirable traits as well as advocates synergistic and complementary approaches in molecular and systems biology to develop new rice breeds that favorably respond to DS-HTS-induced abiotic stress.

AB  - The increasing need for eco-friendly green building and creative passive design technology in response to climatic change and global warming issues will continue. However, the need to preserve and sustain the natural environment is also crucial. A building envelope plays a pivotal role in areas where the greatest heat and energy loss often occur. Investment for the passive design aspect of building envelopes is essential to address CO2 emission. This research aims to explore the suitability of using integral-monolithic structural insulation fibre-reinforced lightweight aggregate concrete (LWAC) without additional insulation as a building envelope material in a high-rise residential building in the different climatic zones of the world. Polypropylene and steel fibres in different dosages were used in a structural grade expanded clay lightweight aggregate concrete. Physical and thermal properties of fibre reinforced structural LWAC, normal weight concrete (NWC) and bricks were measured in the lab. The Autodesk@Revit-GBS simulation program was implemented to simulate the energy consumption of a 29-storey residential building with shear wall structural system using the proposed fibre-reinforced LWAC materials. Results showed that energy savings between 3.2% and 14.8% were incurred in buildings using the fibre-reinforced LWAC across various climatic regions as compared with traditional NWC and sand-cement brick and clay brick walls. In conclusion, fibre-reinforced LWAC in hot-humid tropical and temperate Mediterranean climates meet the certified Green Building Index (GBI) requirements of less than 150 kW.h.m(-2). However, in extreme climatic conditions of sub-arctic and hot semi-arid desert climates, a thicker wall or additional insulation is required to meet the certified green building requirements. Hence, the energy-saving measure is influenced largely by the use of fibre-reinforced LWAC as a building envelope material rather than because of building orientation.

AB  - As a result of ongoing climate change and more frequent heat events, the regulating services of land cover in terms of moderating and mitigating local temperatures are increasingly important. While the reduced temperatures found in forests and wetlands are recognized, their wider contribution to regional landscape cooling remains largely uncharacterized and unquantified. Herein, we propose and test a new method that estimates the temperature response and inertia of landscapes in high temperatures, based on land cover share. In order to achieve this goal, we combined the MODIS daytime land surface temperature (henceforth LST) time series and CORINE land cover data. We classified the time series in two ways, i.e. by stepwise temperature range (-10/ -5 degrees C to +35/+40 degrees C) and by the occurrence of hot days (days with a mean LST >= 30 degrees C). As an explanatory variable, we developed and used a greenest pixel composite of the MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series. In our study area, covering parts of northeastern Germany and western Poland, the fragmented landscape has heterogeneous temperature patterns, including urban heat islands, warm agricultural areas, cool forests and cold wetlands. We found that at high temperature ranges only forests and wetlands remained comparably cool, with LSTs up to 20.8 degrees C lower than the maximum LST in the study area. The analysis of land cover shares and LSTs revealed the substantial cooling effect of forests and wetlands in line with increasing land cover share in higher temperature ranges, as well as on hot days. The relation between LST and the NDVI indicated vegetation cover as the cause. We propose the corresponding metrics to quantify landscapelevel temperature regulation. Equally, we advocate for management to identify these ecosystem services and their current and potential contributions, along with implications for sustaining and increasing, both tree cover and wetlands and thereby adapting landscapes to climate change.

AB  - Developing stable, economic, safer and carbon-based nanoparticles from agro solid waste facilitates a new dimension of advancement for eco-friendly nanomaterials in competition to existing nanoparticles. Herewith, a three dimensional highly porous honeycomb structured carbon-based coconut shell (CS) nanoparticle is prepared through green synthesis technique using tube furnace to energies organic phase change material (PCM). CS nanoparticle synthesis using a green approach is incorporated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) using a two-step technique to develop PEG/CS nanocomposite PCM. Thermophysical features of the nanocomposites are characterized using transient hot bridge (ThB), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), whereas optical property and chemical stability is evaluated using UV-Vis and FTIR spectrometers. Resulting nanocomposite demonstrates higher thermal conductivity by 114.5 % (improved from 0.24 W/ m.K to 0.515 W/m.K). Energy storage enthalpy increased from 141.2 J/g to 150.1 J/g with 1.0 % weight fraction of CS nanoparticles. Optical absorbance of the nanocomposite is improved by 2.14 times compared to base PCM. The developed nanocomposite samples exhibit extreme thermal stability up to 215 degrees C. The 3D porous structure of CS nanoparticles shows better contact area with PEG, causing low interfacial thermal resistance for improved thermal network channels and pathways for extra heat transfer and phonon propagation.

AB  - Under-resolved direct numerical simulations of turbulence in the wake of a single-square-grid (SSG) are conducted using the lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM), with varying degrees of partial moment entropic stabilisation. Turbulence statistics along the grid centreline show satisfactory agreement with literature, greatly outperforming a control study employing the single-relaxation-time Smagorinsky LES model with equivalent resolution. The coarse-resolution entropic LBM simulations are able to capture the qualitative behaviour of the anisotropic and non-homogeneous turbulence generated by the SSG, indicating possible extension of the capability of the entropic lattice-Boltzmann method to simulate more exotic forms of turbulence beyond those reported by the majority of current studies. However, in the extreme near field of the single-square-grid, pseudo-compressibility effects, even at a low lattice Mach number, undermine LBM predictions for turbulence which is generated by action of the pressure Hessian - this is found to be an issue for all models studied, and not a numerical artefact of the entropic stabilisation. With regard to the action of the entropic stabiliser, a comparison of models employing differing degrees of stabilisation on higher-order natural moments suggest that the trace of the stress tensor should not be subject to entropic control for better accuracy in turbulence prediction.

AB  - Simulations of five November months (2010-2014) using the urban version of the numerical weather prediction system of the Meteorological Service Singapore (uSINGV) are used to analyse the urban effect on convective precipitation over Singapore and Johor Bahru (Malaysia). The model is able to closely predict locations where rainfall peaks occur, but rainfall totals are overestimated compared to radar data. The temporal variability of rainfall in the region shows that urban areas increase the frequency and severity of rainfall events and that such impact increases with the rainfall intensity. Results show that low-level moisture advection is enhanced in this coastal conurbation as a result of the strengthening of wind convergence. The latter is likely caused by increasing sea-breeze strength due to lower surface pressure over the urban area, and higher urban surface roughness, respectively. As a consequence, more precipitable water is available in the region, enhancing convection and increasing the probability of heavy rainfall over the centre and north of Singapore island and Johor Bahru. Stronger convection further increases moisture advection from the vicinity. By studying the temporal variability and the spatial distribution of rainfall events, the present study provides new insights on the urban impact on heavy rainfall in tropical areas. The conclusions are only valid for the November inter-monsoon period, when local forcing, rather than large-scale influences, dominates rainfall generation.

AB  - Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplifies specific deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) targets whereby the reaction vessels are placed in high thermal inertia media and subjected to multiple cycles of discrete temperatures to effect denaturation, annealing and extension events. Precise temperature control and efficient heat transfer are crucial factors in achieving amplification reproducibility and reliability as well as in reducing the time required for PCR. Understanding the temperature distribution and transfer characteristics during PCR will facilitate system optimization to enhance the efficiency of DNA amplification. We describe a numerical thermal study investigating temperature profiles achieved using the classical method of manual transfer of PCR reaction vessels through a series of temperature-controlled media compared with that of a more recently reported method that displaces reaction vessels spatially by tilting through different temperature zones. It was found that while the classical method allows the reagent to achieve uniform temperature distribution, natural convection effects would necessitate translation speeds in excess of 150 mm/min in order to limit the reagent temperature drop to within 10 degrees C. With the tilt method, uniform temperature distributions as well as temperature settling times within 5 s could be attained. The simulation results demonstrated here indicate that the tilt method can be developed further to augment extreme PCR requiring less than 2s for each cycle. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Soft robots are susceptible to premature failure from physical damages incurred within dynamic environments. To address this, we report an elastomer with high toughness, room temperature self-healing, and strong adhesiveness, allowing both prevention of damages and recovery for soft robotics. By functionalizing polyurethane with hierarchical hydrogen bonds from ureido-4[1H]-pyrimidinone (UPy) and carboxyl groups, high toughness (74.85 MJ m(-3)), tensile strength (9.44 MPa), and strain (2340%) can be achieved. Furthermore, solvent-assisted self-healing at room temperature enables retention of high toughness (41.74 MJ m(-3)), tensile strength (5.57 MPa), and strain (1865%) within only 12 h. The elastomer possesses a high dielectric constant (approximate to 9) that favors its utilization as a self-healing dielectric elastomer actuator (DEA) for soft robotics. Displaying high area strains of approximate to 31.4% and approximate to 19.3% after mechanical and electrical self-healing, respectively, the best performing self-healable DEA is achieved. With abundant hydrogen bonds, high adhesive strength without additional curing or heating is also realized. Having both actuation and adhesive properties, a "stick-on" strategy for the assembly of robust soft robots is realized, allowing soft robotic components to be easily reassembled or replaced upon severe damage. This study highlights the potential of soft robots with extreme ruggedness for different operating conditions.

AB  - Non-Newtonian behavior of a Phase Change Material (PCM) inside a porous coaxial pipe is studied by utilizing the deformed mesh technique. The inner and outer pipes are subjected to the high and low temperatures of T-h and T-c while the bottom and upper surfaces are thermally insulated. The Finite Element Method (FEM), implemented in the Arbitrary Eulerian-Lagrangian (ALE) moving grid technique, is applied to solve the weakened forms of the governing equations. Stefan's condition is employed to track the solid-liquid interface of the PCM during the melting process. Grid independency test is conducted, and the verifications of the results are evaluated through comparisons with several test cases published in the literature. The simulations show that an increment of Stefan's number can significantly improve the melting rate. As the Stefan number reaches from 0.014 to 0.01, the full melting non-dimensional time declines from 1.313 to 0.937.

AB  - Drought is a dominant climatic feature in arid and semiarid regions. Climate change, temperature variability, and anthropogenic activities caused an increase in agricultural droughts in many regions. Investigation of drought dynamics is important for innovative planning and management of natural resources in drought-prone areas. Remote sensing indices and earth observational datasets were used in this study to investigate droughts in the Bikaner city of Rajasthan, India. Vegetation condition index (VCI), temperature condition index (TCI), and vegetation health index (VHI), estimated from multitemporal Landsat datasets, were used for monitoring the drought-prone areas. Land use land cover (LULC) map, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and surface temperature were also calculated for monitoring the decadal changes in surface features. The results showed that barren lands decreased from around 162.75 to 79.59 km(2). The annual average temperature increased by 0.72 degrees C, while agricultural land increased by 33.83 km(2) during 1990-2020. There was a gradual increase in droughts, but the increase was more in recent years than in the early period. The climatic condition revealed from VCI, TCI, and NDVI maps indicated most of the Bikaner city is prone to moderate and extreme droughts. The study indicates the need for VCI-based real-time drought monitoring for drought management.

AB  - A membrane is a thin layer or sheet at the interface of two material compartments aimed for separation and purification processes. Membranes made using nanofibers, termed as nanomembranes, are preferred at these interfaces to improve the materials and process efficiency because the extreme small size not only lowers the materials requirements but also controls the pore size and distribution. Among the nanofabrication techniques, electrospinning is an industrially viable method of preparing nanomembranes due to its tunable properties as well as affordability. Herein, techniques to modify electrospun nanomembranes (ENMs) for process improvement, such as post-heat treatment, coating, additives, interfacial polymerization, surface chemistry control, pore size and porosity control, hydrophobicity/ hydrophilicity, and flux rejection efficiency at liquid-liquid and solid-liquid interfaces are reviewed. The ENMs in desalination of seawater, textile wastewater remediation, agriculture, biomedical, renewable energy, electrical, and food industries have also been investigated. We also review ENM's potential in liquid gating, which has been cited as one of the top ten emerging technologies. This review also finds areas requiring innovation on ENMs and on the sustainability of the electrospinning technology. Thus, this review provides a one-stop center for various membrane applications at liquid-liquid and solid-liquid interfaces and areas requiring further innovation.

AB  - This article explores the use of raytracing software and heat load models to optimise the growing of crops vertically and by doing so, serves to increase the plausibility of urban Vertical Farms (VFs). Crop trays are modelled using a computer aided design (CAD) software and is then imported into a raytracing software TracePro-2019. Parameters obtained from the heat load and angle calculations would be used to start the simulation. Thereafter, solar irradiance obtained would be compared to different simulations with different design parameters. For this paper, the main design variable would be the tray width and tray inclination angle. After multiple simulations, it was found that trays at the bottom are less affected by varying angles of sunlight while trays at the top receive extreme variations. It was also noted that while the shaded area increases as tray inclination increases, the solar irradiance flux on each tray increases as opposed to decreasing. This new finding led to the conclusion that an increase in the angle of attack of the solar irradiance increased the occurrence of reflected and diffused irradiance. By just tilting the trays by 20, it allows more light to reach inwards, which would allow for a longer width of the trays. This in turn also increases the total yield of a tray in a limited space. This discovery can be utilised for the layout and arrangement for indoor VFs that relies on external solar irradiance for a light source and is proof that crop yield can be increased without adding extra energy consumption.
   Highlights
   Food engineering education in solar based VF system.
   Discuss challenges faced in modern land-scarce urban agriculture farms.
   TracePro 2019 for raytracing used in conjunction with ASHRAE sunlight modelling method.
   Tray width to height ratio is highly dependent on, to maximise crop yield while retaining amount of sunlight received for indoor vertical farming.
   Tilting of crop trays towards the sunlight is the most cost effective and energy saving way to maximise solar flux and space usage.
   External direct solar irradiance flux on crop trays decreases as tray inclination angles increases, but overall solar irradiance increases as steeper angles results in increased reflected solar irradiance.
   Capturing of reflected and diffused irradiance should be prioritised rather than maximising direct irradiance.

AB  - The relationship between social factors and the formation of exported mug designs is blurred. This study addresses how they influence material design. Based on a quantitative typological analysis, this paper interprets the cultural relationships underlying the evolution of mug designs exported during the Ming and Qing dynasties. The study reveals: (1) the typology and handle styles of mugs can be categorized into six types, with a predominance of Cylindrical bodies and Ear-shaped handles. Notably, artistic emphasis is concentrated on Bulbous cup bodies and Tail outward curved handles; (2) the design of mugs in the eighteenth century exhibited diversity, morphological similarities, and feature continuity, evolving from representational (Ming Dynasty) to abstract and then to minimalistic styles (Qing Dynasty), particularly evident in the three-dimensional modeling of handles for ergonomic comfort (transitioning from a singular Outward curved form to Ear-shaped form, and then to Entwined branch form); (3) the body shape of mugs transformed from Arc-barrel bodies to Bulbous bodies (focusing on heat retention), and eventually to Cylindrical bodies (prioritizing heat retention, practicality, and cost-efficiency).; (4) the volume of mugs steadily increased from the early eighteenth century, generally classified into large volume (>= 500 ml), medium volume (200-499 ml), and small volume (< 200 ml); (5) considering the extreme range of volume (11090 ml) and height (25 cm), it indicates that these two variables do not necessarily have a direct positive correlation; (6) the low center of gravity in handle design (average width of 3.4 cm against an average height of 9.9 cm for the body) reflects considerations for the distribution of liquid weight and operational convenience. The volume of sample-10 (11127 ml) notably exceeds the typical range for tea-drinking utensils, revealing the mechanism of wealth and status symbolism. Market demand orientation emerged as the primary driver for the evolution of export mug designs during the Ming and Qing Dynasties, with adjustments in the merchant system playing a secondary role. The transformation in mug design reflects the interplay of multiple factors, with the trend toward minimalist design being a response to market demands.

AB  - Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been recognized vastly as stimuli-responsive materials owing to their extreme sensitivity toward the stimuli that make them flawless nominees for multifunctional device applications. However, MOFs are often oversensitive toward moisture, which significantly affects their stable responses and reproducibility. Herein, a MOF-polymer display (i.e., copper-based MOF with polydimethylsiloxane) is developed that exhibits high sensitivity toward temperature changes without getting affected by moisture. In response to the thermal gradient, the display exhibits the change in color from sky blue to dark blue when the temperature varies from 30 to 100 degrees C, which is attributed to the second-order phase transition within the time interval 40 s and reversible in 60 s. To provide insights on the mechanism, ex situ UV-vis and temperature-dependent operando X-day diffraction are conducted, which unveils that the color change in the display is associated with reversible contraction/expansion of the unit cell parameters. In addition to that, the thermoresponse of the display remains unaffected under mechanical deformations, which indicates that the color display is mechanically and thermally stable. The as-developed color display is mechanically robust and highly sensitive toward temperature change; it can be utilized as the color indicator in signaling temperature rise in smart mobiles or laptops during discharging to keep the user safe or applications in augmented intelligence.
   Metal-organic framework-polydimethylsiloxane-based flexible and stretchable display exhibits color change upon heating or cooling due to reversible ingress/digress of water molecules.image (c) 2024 WILEY-VCH GmbH

AB  - Flexible pressure sensors with high sensitivity over a broad pressure range are highly desired, yet challenging to build to meet the requirements of practical applications in daily activities and more significant in some extreme environments. This work demonstrates a thin, lightweight, and high-performance pressure sensor based on flexible porous phenyl-silicone/functionalized carbon nanotube (PS/FCNT) film. The formed crack-across-pore endows the pressure sensor with high sensitivity of 19.77 kPa(-1) and 1.6 kPa(-1) in the linear range of 0-33 kPa and 0.2-2 MPa, respectively, as well as ultralow detection limit (similar to 1.3 Pa). Furthermore, the resulting pressure sensor possesses a low fatigue over 4000 loading/unloading cycles even under a high pressure of 2 MPa and excellent durability (>6000 cycles) after heating at high temperature (200 degrees C), attributed to the strong chemical bonding between PS and FCNT, excellent mechanical stability, and high temperature resistance of PS/FCNT film. These superior properties set a foundation for applying the single sensor device in detecting diverse stimuli from the very low to high pressure range, including weak airflow, sway, vibrations, biophysical signal monitoring, and even car pressure. Besides, a deep neural network based on transformer (TRM) has been engaged for human action recognition with an overall classification rate of 94.96% on six human actions, offering high accuracy in real-time practical scenarios.

AB  - Corrosion resistance of additively manufactured (AM) alloy 22 using Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) was studied and compared with their wrought counterparts in 5 wt.% NaCl (pH similar to 7.0) and 5 wt.% NaCl + 1.0 M HCl (pH similar to -0.5) solutions. The L-PBF process parameters were selected from two extremes of a volumetric energy density (VED) process window. The effect of post-manufacturing processes on corrosion was also studied; these processes involved hot isostatic pressing (HIP) and solution treatment (ST). In 5 wt% NaCl, AM alloy 22 samples corrosion characteristics compared closely to wrought alloy 22 except when process parameters resulted in large pores, which acted as initiation sites for localized corrosion. In the acidic solutions, it was observed that the porosity and grain structure significantly affected corrosion performance. In general, the L-PBF-produced samples at higher VED (750 J/mm(3)) had lower porosity than samples produced at lower VED (188 J/mm(3)), which contributed to better corrosion performance. However, the lower Sigma 3 grain boundaries correlated to lower corrosion performance for all samples. HIP processing significantly lowered the porosity of the samples produced at lower VED and allowed for recrystallization of grain boundaries to increase the proportion of Sigma 3 grain boundaries, enhancing corrosion performance to near-wrought alloy 22 even in acidic solutions and at elevated temperatures.

AB  - To effectively supply the multi-energy loads and achieve the annual zero energy targets of zero energy buildings (ZEBs) throughout the planning horizon, this paper proposes a tri-level multi-energy system planning method for ZEBs considering both long- and short-term uncertainties. In the upper level, the optimal goal is to obtain an optimal device sizing scheme within the electric-thermal-hydrogen integrated multi-energy system (EHT-MES). The middle and lower levels tackle the long-term temperature change and short-term source-load uncertainties separately. For the former, a set of representative scenarios that include typical and extreme weather conditions are generated from the future temperature forecast dataset, and an ambiguous set is utilized to model the uncertain probability distributions of the scenario set. For the latter, to guarantee the reliable and economic operation of ZEBs under different seasonal-daily patterns, a hybrid stochastic and robust optimization (HSRO) method is applied to deal with short-term uncertainties from solar radiation, wind output, outdoor temperature, electric loads, and hot water loads. A reformulation method is proposed to transform the multi-level coupling planning model into an equivalent and tractable form, and an improved column-and-constraint generation (C & CG) algorithm is developed to solve the recast model. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed planning method in deploying ZEBs' multi-energy devices and immunizing against multiple timescale uncertainties.

AB  - The climate is currently warming fast, threatening biodiversity all over the globe. Populations often adapt rapidly to environmental change, but for climate warming very little evidence is available. Here, we investigate the pattern of adaptation to an extreme +10 degrees C climate change in the wild, following the introduction of brine shrimp Artemia franciscana from San Francisco Bay, USA, to Vinh Chau saltern in Vietnam. We use a resurrection ecology approach, hatching diapause eggs from the ancestral population and the introduced population after 13 and 24 years (similar to 54 and similar to 100 generations, respectively). In a series of coordinated experiments, we determined whether the introduced Artemia show increased tolerance to higher temperatures, and the extent to which genetic adaptation, developmental plasticity, transgenerational effects, and local microbiome differences contributed to this tolerance. We find that introduced brine shrimp do show increased phenotypic tolerance to warming. Yet strikingly, these changes do not have a detectable additive genetic component, are not caused by mitochondrial genetic variation, and do not seem to be caused by epigenetic marks set by adult parents exposed to warming. Further, we do not find any developmental plasticity that would help cope with warming, nor any protective effect of heat-tolerant local microbiota. The evolved thermal tolerance might therefore be entirely due to transgenerational (great)grandparental effects, possibly epigenetic marks set by parents who were exposed to high temperatures as juveniles. This study is a striking example of "missing heritability," where a large adaptive phenotypic change is not accompanied by additive genetic effects.

AB  - Global warming and extreme weather events (e.g., heat waves and droughts) have caused widespread adverse impacts across regions and sectors, including shrimp farming. However, the availability of in situ water temperature data typically only represents a small portion of shrimp farms' thermal profiles, and this often leads to limitations in investigating the impacts of global warming and climate change on shrimp farming. For this aim, satellite-derived water surface temperature (WST) at shrimp farms in Mong Cai City, Quang Ninh Province, Vietnam, was investigated by using Landsat data in the Google Earth Engine. Results showed that satellite-derived WST at shrimp farms in Mong Cai City ranged from 11.5 degrees C to 37.6 degrees C in 2000-2003, mainly concentrated at 15-35 degrees C (around 95% retrieved WST from Landsat data). There was a seasonal variation of WST at shrimp farms, with monthly mean WST ranged from 18.4 degrees C (January) to 29.9 degrees C (July). The mean annual WST at shrimp farms in Mong Cai City showed an increasing trend from 2000 to 2022. A remarkable warming trend of WST was detected during the shrimp-growing season (from April to October), and this may lead to a high risk for shrimp health. The findings of this study indicated that greater awareness of water temperature monitoring at shrimp farms is required if this activity is to be sustainable in the climate change context.

AB  - We have investigated cloud formation over the South China Sea in the upper troposphere and its impacts on the radiation budget of the troposphere and ocean surface under monsoon surges using satellite and reanalysis products and an atmospheric numerical model. During strong surges (SS), the upper tropospheric (UT) cloud formation in central South China Sea shows a clear diurnal cycle, peaking around 12-14 local solar time when the incoming solar radiation is the strongest. The enhanced UT clouds attenuate the incoming solar radiation in the upper troposphere reducing the net downward shortwave radiation flux at the surface by approximately 28% in SS compared with no surge case. In contrast the downward longwave radiation flux is enhanced mainly from the middle to upper troposphere in SS. The cooling because of the diminished incoming shortwave radiation overwhelms the warming due to the longwave radiation at the ocean surface. This cloud radiative forcing is observed partly over the cold tongue in sea surface temperature (SST) in the South China Sea. Numerical simulations with a 1-dimensional slab ocean model suggests that the monsoon-induced UT cloud radiative forcing contributes partially to maintain and reinforce the SST cold tongue with a tendency of about 0.08 K in 6 days or about 1/6 of one standard deviation of the Cold Tongue Index in December. The latent heat flux due to the monsoon surge is still the most significant factor maintaining the cold tongue.

AB  - Because of evident climatic variations and significant contribution to national food production, Bangladesh is a climate extreme hotspot region of examination for climatic consequences for rice (Oryza Sativa) crop production. This study intends to explore the variability of climatic variables (e.g., variations in mean temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, and sunshine duration) with rice yields (e.g., Aus, Aman, and Boro rice varieties) in northwest Bangladesh. The modified Mann-Kendall test, Theil-Sen slope estimator, and multiple linear regression (MLR) modeling were used to estimate the association among these factors. Heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation constant standard error (HAC) and feasible generalized least square (FGLS) technique were adopted to measure the climate-rice crop nexus using the regional level dataset for 1976-2015. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal variation of rice yield trends with climatic variables was mapped and assessed by the coefficient of variation. The results show that observed temperature and humidity trends were beneficial for Aus and Aman yields but not Boro yields. In contrast, observed rainfall and sunshine trends were negative for all three rice seasons. The outcomes of the MLR model explained 67%, 92%, and 83% of the variability in Aus, Aman, and Boro rice yields in the study region. The model outcomes showed that humidity and rainfall have negatively affected Aus and Aman rice crops, while temperature and rainfall positively influence Boro rice yield. Regarding the climate change issues and safeguarding food safety at the regional level, the concerned authorities should provide substantial attention to improving heat and drought-tolerance high-yielding varieties against climate effects on Aus and Aman rice varieties.

AB  - Coastlines are drastically altered globally due to urbanisation and climate-related issues. As a response, communities build coastal defence structures to protect people and property. Although these infrastructures fulfil engineering demands of coastal defences, the trade-off to nature includes a decrease in biodiversity able to live on these structures because of the lack of topographic complexity. Several studies have tried to increase the surface complexity on coastal defence structures through eco-engineering habitat enhancements that mimic nature. However, few of these studies have been conducted in tropical regions where effects are more pronounce due to desiccation and extreme heat. In this study, water-retaining structures (in the form of rock-pools at depths 12 cm, and 5 cm) were drill-cored into coastal defence structures (i.e. granite rock revetments) on reclaimed coastlines in Penang Island, Malaysia. We found greater species richness and an increase in community structure in the drill-cored rock pools regardless of the depth of these artificial rock-pools. Positive habitat selection also occurred within micro-habitats of this scale. The drill-cored artificial rock pools in these tidal exposed revetments also provided niche-spaces for marine organisms found in low-tide or sub-tidal areas. These findings demonstrate the potential of this eco-engineered habitat enhancement as a means of promoting biodiversity on granite rock revetments, which can be applied either during design phase of a coastal development or retrospectively.

AB  - Introduction: The significant impact of climate change on temperature is an important topic of discussion as it rises globally. Hence, the present study is designed to investigate the profound influence of climate change on temperature by considering the North Indian States.Methods: In this comprehensive case study, CMIP6 models are used to investigate temperature behaviour in the states of North India under 1.5 & DEG;C and 2 & DEG;C warming scenarios. Comparisons are made between observed surface temperature data from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and ensemble mean simulations from CMIP6.Results and Discussion: Results indicate that CMIP6 ensemble mean simulations effectively depict observed climatological patterns of surface temperature with negligible discrepancies. Under both the 1.5 & DEG;C and 2 & DEG;C warming scenarios, extreme temperatures show an increase compared to the preindustrial and present periods, suggesting an elevated risk of future severe heat events. Temperature changes relative to the preindustrial period are around 1.5 & DEG;C, 3 & DEG;C, and 4.5 & DEG;C for the present, 1.5 & DEG;C, and 2 & DEG;C scenarios, respectively. Return period analysis shows a significant temperature rise of approximately 4.5 & DEG; over a return time of 60 years. These findings highlight the importance of climate models, valuable for impact studies, and emphasize the need to accurately enhance future model iterations' precision in simulating regional climates. Urgent climate change mitigation strategies are vital to curb temperature rise and mitigate potential adverse impacts on the region.Conclusion: The study provides critical insights into North India's climate behavior, underscoring the significance of proactive measures to effectively address climate change challenges within the region.

AB  - El Nino Southern Oscillation is one of the significant phenomena that drives global climate variability, showing a relationship with extreme events. Reliable forecasting of ENSO phases can minimize the risks in many critical areas, including water supply, food security, health, and public safety on a global scale. This study develops an ENSO forecasting model using the dynamic evolving neural fuzzy inference system (DENFIS), an artificial intelligence-based data-driven algorithm. To forecast ENSO phases for 1, 2, and 3 months ahead, 42 years (1979-2021) of monthly data of 25 oceanic and continental climatic variables and ENSO-characterizing indices are used. The dataset includes 12 El Nino and 14 La Nina events, of which the latest 2 El Nino and 4 La Nina events are reserved for testing while the remaining data are used for training the model. The potential input variables to the model are short-listed using a cross-correlation analysis. Then a systematic input selection procedure is conducted to identify the best input combinations for the model. The results of this study show that the best performing combination of such climate variables could achieve up to 78.57% accuracy in predicting short-term ENSO phases (up to 3 months ahead). Heat content at 0 to 300 m of central equatorial Pacific shows promising performance in forecasting ENSO phases. Moreover, DENFIS was found to be a reliable tool for forecasting ENSO events using multiple oceanic and continental climate variables.

AB  - Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM)-cycling plants display both the C-3 and CAM photosynthetic pathways at various extents in response to environmental and plant physiological conditions. Evolved from the C-3 metabolism, CAM is a photosynthetic adaptation specialised to improve plant water-use efficiency by shifting/extending the CO2 uptake from the day to the night. Obligate CAM plants such as the Agave species, pineapples, orchids, and prickly pears are highly productive and respond favourably to extreme heat and drought, and water-limited environments. In comparison to the C-3 and C-4 plants, agricultural CAM crops can thrive in semi-arid and arid lands, making them an ideal and sustainable commercial crop for food and energy. Very few plants exhibit the CAM-cycling pathway, while the fairly well-known examples include Mesembryanthemum crystallinum (ice plant) and Jatropha curcas (physic nut). In such plants bestowed with the ability to interchange different photosynthetic metabolisms, little is known on how each unique photosynthetic metabolism is likely to contribute to overall plant growth and development. This article explores the utilisation of CAM for biomass and yield improvement in a bioenergy crop (J. curcas) conferred with CAM-cycling photosynthetic machinery. The J. curcas photosynthetic-associated parameters, yield components in relation to transcriptomic data analyses from previous studies are described and discussed to benefit plant breeding programs targeted for productivity enhancement.

AB  - Demand-side flexibility (DSF) has been touted as a possible solution to the challenges in power system operation arising from increasing intermittent renewables penetration and the emergence of electric vehicles. In Singapore, where around 24 to 60% of electricity demand in buildings could be attributed to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) purposes, air-conditioned buildings represent a significant flexibility resource which could be used to provide DSF and help tackle these challenges. This study aims to investigate the DSF potential of Singapore's building stock and to explore how this potential could be realized through demand-side bidding. To this end, a building energy modeling tool with explicit modeling of the relationship between occupant comfort and HVAC load with model predictive control, CoBMo, is used. CoBMo allows optimal load scheduling to be expressed as a linear programming problem: minimizing overall electricity cost while maintaining occupant comfort. A price-based market clearing model is developed to evaluate demand side bidding implementation, for which a case study on Singapore's Downtown Core district is developed. Three scenarios with possible future utility-scale photovoltaic (PV) penetration in Singapore's electricity system are explored, alongside a sensitivity analysis and a comparison between centralized dispatch and demand-side bidding with price-quantity pairs and linear curves. Results of the analysis show that DSF potential varies between building types, depending on cooling load and occupancy schedule. When extreme price fluctuations happen in future Singapore electricity market with 10 GWp PV penetration, demand-side bidding could aid consumers to utilize their DSF potential by encouraging more effective energy use and in turn, reducing their total electricity cost.

AB  - The climate science and applications communities need a broad and demand-driven concept to assess physical climate conditions that are relevant for impacts on human and natural systems. Here, we augment the description of the "climatic impact-driver" (CID) approach adopted in the Working Group I (WGI) contribution to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report. CIDs are broadly defined as "physical climate system conditions (e.g., means, events, and extremes) that affect an element of society or ecosystems. Depending on system tolerance, CIDs and their changes can be detrimental, beneficial, neutral, or a mixture of each across interacting system elements and regions." We give background information on the IPCC Report process that led to the development of the 7 CID types (heat and cold, wet and dry, wind, snow and ice, coastal, open ocean, and other) and 33 distinct CID categories, each of which may be evaluated using a variety of CID indices. This inventory of CIDs was co-developed with WGII to provide a useful collaboration point between physical climate scientists and impacts/risk experts to assess the specific climatic phenomena driving sectoral responses and identify relevant CID indices within each sector. The CID Framework ensures that a comprehensive set of climatic conditions informs adaptation planning and risk management and may also help prioritize improvements in modeling sectoral dynamics that depend on climatic conditions. CIDs contribute to climate services by increasing coherence and neutrality when identifying and communicating relevant findings from physical climate research to risk assessment and planning activities.

AB  - The asymmetric increase in average nighttime temperatures relative to increase in average daytime temperatures due to climate change is decreasing grain yield and quality in rice. Therefore, a better genome-level understanding of the impact of higher night temperature stress on the weight of individual grains is essential for future development of more resilient rice. We investigated the utility of metabolites obtained from grains to classify high night temperature (HNT) conditions of genotypes, and metabolites and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to predict grain length, width, and perimeter phenotypes using a rice diversity panel. We found that the metabolic profiles of rice genotypes alone could be used to classify control and HNT conditions with high accuracy using random forest or extreme gradient boosting. Best linear unbiased prediction and BayesC showed greater metabolic prediction performance than machine learning models for grain-size phenotypes. Metabolic prediction was most effective for grain width, resulting in the highest prediction performance. Genomic prediction performed better than metabolic prediction. Integrating metabolites and genomics simultaneously in a prediction model slightly improved prediction performance. We did not observe a difference in prediction between the control and HNT conditions. Several metabolites were identified as auxiliary phenotypes that could be used to enhance the multi-trait genomic prediction of grain-size phenotypes. Our results showed that, in addition to SNPs, metabolites collected from grains offer rich information to perform predictive analyses, including classification modeling of HNT responses and regression modeling of grain-size-related phenotypes in rice.

AB  - Food fraud is a global problem raising increased concerns during the past decades and food authenticity is now a burning issue. Beef, buffalo, chicken, duck, goat, sheep, and pork are heavily consumed meats bearing nutritional, economic and cultural/religious importance and are often found to be adulterated in raw and processed states. To authenticate these species, we developed and validated a highly specific multiplex (heptaplex) PCR assay targeting short length amplicons (73-263 bp) using seven pairs of species-specific primer sets targeting mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5) genes. Specificity checking (in silico and in vitro) against 25 non-target species revealed no cross-species amplification. The developed multiplex assay was validated with various adulterated and heat-treated (boiled, microwaved and autoclaved) meatball products and were found to show high sensitivity and stability under all processing conditions. The assay was sensitive enough to detect 0.01-0.005 ng of DNA from raw meat and 0.5% (w/w) adulterated meat in mixed matrices. A market survey revealed mislabelling of 95% beef and 15% chicken products while pork products were found pure. Given some advantageous features including short sizes of amplicons, exceptional stability and superior sensitivity, the developed assay could be conveniently used for discriminatory detection of target species with a variety of raw meat as well as processed meat products undergoing extreme processing treatments.

AB  - Background: Climate change significantly impacts health in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), exacerbating vulnerabilities. Comprehensive data for evidence-based research and decision-making is crucial but scarce. Health and Demographic Surveillance Sites (HDSSs) in Africa and Asia provide a robust infrastructure with longitudinal population cohort data, yet they lack climate-health specific data. Acquiring this information is essential for understanding the burden of climate-sensitive diseases on populations and guiding targeted policies and interventions in LMICs to enhance mitigation and adaptation capacities.
   Objective: The objective of this research is to develop and implement the Change and Health Evaluation and Response System (CHEERS) as a methodological framework, designed to facilitate the generation and ongoing monitoring of climate change and health-related data within existing Health and Demographic Surveillance Sites (HDSSs) and comparable research infrastructures.
   Methods: CHEERS uses a multi-tiered approach to assess health and environmental exposures at the individual, household, and community levels, utilizing digital tools such as wearable devices, indoor temperature and humidity measurements, remotely sensed satellite data, and 3D-printed weather stations. The CHEERS framework utilizes a graph database to efficiently manage and analyze diverse data types, leveraging graph algorithms to understand the complex interplay between health and environmental exposures.
   Results: The Nouna CHEERS site, established in 2022, has yielded significant preliminary findings. By using remotely-sensed data, the site has been able to predict crop yield at a household level in Nouna and explore the relationships between yield, socioeconomic factors, and health outcomes. The feasibility and acceptability of wearable technology have been confirmed in rural Burkina Faso for obtaining individual-level data, despite the presence of technical challenges. The use of wearables to study the impact of extreme weather on health has shown significant effects of heat exposure on sleep and daily activity, highlighting the urgent need for interventions to mitigate adverse health consequences.
   Conclusion: Implementing the CHEERS in research infrastructures can advance climate change and health research, as large and longitudinal datasets have been scarce for LMICs. This data can inform health priorities, guide resource allocation to address climate change and health exposures, and protect vulnerable communities in LMICs from these exposures.

AB  - In response to environmental and climate change issues in recent decades, clean energy resources have been promoted as substitutes for fossil fuel-based dirty energy resources. While receiving great attention from environmentally conscious investors and policy-makers, the markets for the former energies could be affected by financial instability in the markets for the latter, which could lead to systemic risk and directional connect-edness. In this paper, we aimed to assess potential systemic risk in such markets by employing conditional quantile-and conditional expectile-based Value-at-Risk (henceforth CoVaR and CoEVaR, respectively). Due to their definition through expected conditional asymmetric loss functions, we adopted Kabaila's efficient method for the computation of conditional expectations and proposed a backtesting technique based on Diebold and Mariano's test. Using Delta-CoVaR and Delta-CoEVaR, we constructed conditional tail risk networks to describe the directional tail risk connectedness. We revealed that the CoVaR and CoEVaR for almost all pairs of energy markets had the best forecast accuracy when computed using a copula exhibiting symmetric tail dependence with asymmetric and heavy-tailed margins. Compared to CoVaR, CoEVaR possessed a relatively better conditional coverage performance in several cases, complementing its advantage of being more sensitive to (extreme) loss magnitude. In addition, we found crude oil, heating oil, and sectoral clean energy indices to be highly interconnected, but the connectedness weakened following the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. In particular, crude oil and the renewable energy sector played a consistent role as the most systemically important net receiver and net transmitter, respectively. These results provided important implications for policy-makers and investors aware of systemic risk and connectedness among dirty and clean energy markets.

AB  - Recently, astronomers have reached a significant milestone on a journey of Universe exploration with more than 5400 confirmed exoplanets. Therefore determining the physical properties of minerals in the terapascal area has become an urgent mission to gain insights into exoplanetary dynamics and evolution. Herein, we develop a theoretical model to obtain a more reliable picture of the ultrahigh-pressure structural transformation in iron, which is the most prominent metal in the core of super-Earths, gas giants, and ice giants. First, we revisit the previously computed hcp-fcc boundary under extreme conditions between 3 and 7 TPa. Available ab initio data for the ground-state energy are utilized to construct the Rydberg pairwise potential for iron. On that basis, the statistical moment method is improved to calculate the total vibrational free energy without enormous computational workloads. Our analyses reveal that the widely employed quasiharmonic approximation is insufficient to capture the hcp-fcc phase-transition behaviors of iron. The primary reason is that the lack of inversion symmetry creates strong odd-order anharmonic effects, thereby enhancing the thermodynamic stability of the hcp structure. Second, we extend the modified work-heat equivalence principle to deduce the melting quantities from the Holzapfel equation-of-state parameters up to 10 TPa. Our steep melting lines accord fully with the state-of-the-art static measurements, dynamic experiments, and ab initio simulations. In particular, we observe that the melting gradient of hcp iron is always higher than the adiabatic slope of liquid iron. This difference has a profound geophysical implication for the core solidification and the magnetic-field generation of super-Earths. Finally, we perform numerical calculations for the Hugoniot and isentropic profiles. Our theoretical predictions would facilitate designing future multishock and ramp-wave studies to uncover the mystery of extrasolar worlds.

AB  - Tropical species are predicted to be among the most vulnerable to climate change as they often live close to their upper limits to thermal tolerance and in many cases, behavioural thermoregulation is required to persist in the thermal extremes of tropical latitudes. In concert with warming temperatures, near-shore species are faced with the additional threat of shoreline hardening, leading to a reduction in microhabitats that can provide thermal refuges. This situation is exemplified in Singapore, which lies almost on the equator and so experiences yearround hot temperatures, and much of its coastline is now seawall. To investigate the thermal ecology of a common intertidal gastropod, Nerita undata, on these artificial structures, we measured thermal conditions on two seawalls, the temperatures of habitats occupied by the snail, and compared these with the snail's thermal tolerance by measuring heart rate and behavioural thermoregulation (as preferred temperature, Tpref). At one of the two seawalls (Tanjong Rimau), temperatures experienced by N. undata exceeded all measures of thermal tolerance in the sun, while at the other (Palawan Beach), they did not. Temperatures in habitats occupied by the snails on the seawalls were similar to their measured Tpref in the laboratory and were lower than all measures of thermal tolerance. Behavioural thermoregulation by the snails, therefore, significantly increased the thermal safety margins of N. undata on the relatively homogenous seawalls in Singapore, and at one of the two seawalls were necessary to allow snails to survive. Accordingly, to facilitate motile species to maintain broad thermal safety margins through behavioural regulation, the provision of additional refuges from thermal stress is recommended on artificial coastal defences such as seawalls.

AB  - Foodborne illness caused by consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella is one of the most common causes of diarrheal disease and affects millions of people worldwide. The rising emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance, especially in some serotypes of Salmonella, has raised a great awareness of public health issues worldwide. To ensure safety of the food processing chain, the development of new food preservatives must be expedited. Recently, thermal- and pH-stable antimicrobial peptides have received much attention for use in food production, and represent safe alternatives to chemical preservatives. A 12-mer cathelicidin-derived, alpha-helical cationic peptide, P7, displayed rapid killing activity, against strains of drug-resistant foodborne Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and its monophasic variant (S. enterica serovar 4,5,12:i:-) and had minimal toxicity against mouse fibroblast cells. P7 tended to form helical structure in the membrane-mimic environments as evaluated by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The action mode of P7 at the membrane-level was affirmed by the results of flow cytometry, and confocal, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. P7 killed bacteria through binding to bacterial membranes, penetration and the subsequent accumulation in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium cytoplasm. This induced membrane depolarization, permeabilization, and sequential leakage of intracellular substances and cell death. Except for sensitivity to proteolytic digestive enzymes, P7 maintained its inhibitory activity against S. enterica serovar Typhimurium in the presence of different conditions [various salts, extreme pHs and heat (even at 100 degrees C)]. Moreover, the peptide is unlikely to induce bacterial resistance in vitro. Taken together, this study demonstrated that the membrane-permeabilizing P7 peptide has much potential as a new antimicrobial agent for use in food processing and preservation.

AB  - Ethylene is polymerised by free radicals under extreme conditions of high pressure and temperature to produce low-density polyethylene LDPE. Considering the requirement for high compression power and heating-cooling elements, combined with depleting fossil fuel and climate change issues, an approach is needed to trade-off these issues. As such, an effective approach of multi-objective optimisation study to obtain the optimum production of the LDPE with minimum energy consumption is proposed in this work. The multi-objective artificial hummingbird algorithm with dynamic elimination-based crowding distance (MOAHA-DECD) executes within ASPEN Plus-MATLAB environment for energy saving of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) production. Three problems are addressed: minimise energy cost and maximise productivity for problem 1 (P1); minimising energy cost and maximising conversion for problem 2 (P2); and minimising energy cost, maximising productivity, and maximising conversion for problem 3 (P3). The inlet pressure, the mass flow rate of Initiator 1 (tert-butyl peroxypivalate, TBPPI), and the mass flow rate of Initiator 2 (tert-butyl 3,5,5trimethyl-peroxyhexaonate (TBPIN)) of the reacting zones (zone 3 and zone 5) are considered as decision variables. Pareto solutions obtained are arrayed across the entire Pareto front (PF) with an even sweep and diverse points. Based on the results, the highest productivity, lowest energy cost, and highest conversion are 554.958 Mil. RM/year, 61.388 Mil. RM/year, and 0.320. The decision variable plots show that the mass flow rate of the initiator at the end zone of the reactor highly impacts the optimal option. For the next study, the generated Pareto allows decision-makers to select the most acceptable solution based on their preferences to trade-off economic, energy, and environmental issues.

AB  - Irregular rainfall, rising temperatures and changing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events are projected to reduce crop yields and threaten food security across the tropical monsoon sub-region. However, the anticipated extent of impact on crop yields and crop water productivity (CWP) is not yet thoroughly understood. The impacts of climate change on rice yields and CWP are assessed over the Northern Tonle Sap Basin in Cambodia by applying the AquaCrop model into the mid- (2041-2070) to long- (2071-2099) future under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) (4.5 and 8.5). Short (95 days), medium (125 days) and long (155 days) cycle varieties are tested during the wet and dry seasons. An assessment of different sowing dates and irrigation strategies (fixed and net irrigation during the dry season) elucidated the variation in response to changing environmental conditions. Higher yields (+15% by 2041-2070 and +30% by 2071-2099) and CWP values (+42% by 2071-2099) are expected if using short-cycle varieties, in particular when sown in July. Dry season rice yields are also projected to increase (+28% by 2071-2099) and higher yields are simulated under a higher greenhouse gas emission scenario (RCP 8.5) compared with a medium emission scenario (RCP 4.5) as a result of the CO2 fertilization effect. Depending on the climatic scenario, rice variety, irrigation scheme, and sowing date, increasing heat and drought-stress conditions are likely to have different impacts on rice yields and CWP over time. Overall, this study highlights the benefits of adjusting crop calendars to identify the most suitable irrigation schedules and rice variety to effectively adapt to projected future climate.

AB  - Styrene butadiene rubber (SBR), is a synthetic polymer and the most abundantly used in the tire industry, which have good collaborative properties with additives and fillers. In present work, we aim to synthesize SBR com-posite having the properties of graphene oxide filler and made it to be biodegradable. In composite preparation, we fabricated styrene-butadiene rubber/graphene oxide/lignin composites by adding biodegradable biomolecule of lignin fillers at varying 1-3 wt% quantities amount. Those prepared SBR composites were characterized using advanced analysis techniques, and also their biodegradability was. From microscopy examination results, the morphology of pure SBR composite had been improved after the addition of graphene oxide, while the 1 wt% lignin filled SBR sample revealed well-integrated morphology with crest-and-trough-like feature, showcasing the lignin fibrils could strengthen the molecular interaction between graphene oxide nano sheet and SBR rubber. For 2 wt% lignin filled SBR sample, it exhibited large protuberants due to the aggregation effect of lignin fibrils. However, bulky and bundle structure of protuberant was more significantly formed in 3 wt% lignin filled SBR, as a result of poor interface between lignin and SBR rubber. The porosity had also been improved for 1 wt% lignin filled SBR sample, imparting it with great surface area to act as tire in automobile application. The physico-chemical analysis also detected the trace of graphene oxide and lignin functional groups in the SBR compos-ite. In addition, the thermal analysis revealed those lignin-filled composites had stable heat tolerance behavior, which suitably used in extreme weather condition. Moreover, the 1 wt% lignin filled SBR sample exhibited good characteristics in both mechanical and biodegradable properties. Thus, the composite of 1 wt% lignin filled SBR could be regarded as a promising candidate for green tire application in the future.

AB  - Robusta coffee is the primary source of income for millions of smallholder farmers throughout the world's tropics. The price smallholder farmers can get for their coffee is strongly influenced by bean characteristics (i.e. beans are of a sufficient size and have minimal defects). Climate is a key determinant of successful coffee production, but scant research has been undertaken to test and quantify climate impacts on robusta coffee bean physical characteristics. Here we investigate how climate relates to the risk of poor coffee bean characteristics in one of South East Asia's key coffee producing areas, the central highlands of Vietnam. We use 5 years (2012-2016) of coffee bean characteristic data from 60 farms. Hierarchical modelling was used to investigate how rainfall and temperature related to two indicators of coffee bean characteristics (1) the probability of below average coffee bean size and (2) the probability of above average coffee bean defects. Low rainfall (<1600 mm) during the late growing season (July-September) greatly increased the risk (>80% probability) of below average coffee bean size. Conversely, high rainfall (>750 mm) and high mean minimum temperature (>22 degrees C) during harvest (October-December) increased the risk (>75% probability) of above average coffee bean defects. Various coffee bean characteristic subcomponents (e.g. insect damage and mouldy beans) and different bean sizes were also examined and were affected by a range of rainfall and temperature predictors across the flowering, growing and harvest seasons. With this information targeted risk-management strategies (e.g. targeted irrigation during hot and dry growing seasons, adjusting harvest timing and employing drying techniques during wet and cold harvest periods) could be developed to minimise the effect of climate conditions that increase the risk of coffee bean defects. Successfully managing the impacts identified here, could decrease coffee bean defects and in turn increase the incomes of smallholder coffee farmers.

AB  - Background: Climate change and its subsequent effects on temperature have raised global public health concerns. Although numerous epidemiological studies have shown the adverse health effects of temperature, the association remains unclear for children aged below five years old and those in tropical climate regions.Methods: We conducted a two-stage time-stratified case-crossover study to examine the association between temperature and under-five mortality, spanning the period from 2014 to 2018 across all six regions in Malaysia. In the first stage, we estimated region-specific temperature-mortality associations using a conditional Poisson regression and distributed lag nonlinear models. We used a multivariate meta-regression model to pool the region-specific estimates and examine the potential role of local characteristics in the association, which includes geographical information, demographics, socioeconomic status, long-term temperature metrics, and healthcare access by region.Results: Temperature in Malaysia ranged from 22 degrees C to 31 degrees C, with a mean of 27.6 degrees C. No clear seasonality was observed in under-five mortality. We found no strong evidence of the association between temperature and under-five mortality, with an "M-" shaped exposure-response curve. The minimum mortality temperature (MMT) was identified at 27.1 degrees C. Among several local characteristics, only education level and hospital bed rates reduced the residual heterogeneity in the association. However, effect modification by these variables were not significant.Conclusion: This study suggests a null association between temperature and under-five mortality in Malaysia, which has a tropical climate. The "M-" shaped pattern suggests that under-fives may be vulnerable to temperature changes, even with a small temperature change in reference to the MMT. However, the weak risks with a large uncertainty at extreme temperatures remained inconclusive. Potential roles of education level and hospital bed rate were statistically inconclusive.

AB  - Background Rural populations are at risk of climate-related impacts due to ecological and geographical determinants, potentially leading to greater morbidity and health utilization. They are often highly dependent on primary care services. However, no rural- or primary care specific synthesis of these issues has ever been conducted. This review aimed to identify, characterize, and summarize existing research on the effects of climate-related events on utilization and health outcomes of primary care in rural and remote areas and identify related adaptation strategies used in primary care to climate-related events. Methods A scoping review following PRISMA-ScR guidelines was conducted, examining peer-reviewed English-language articles published up to 31 October 2022. Eligible papers were empirical studies conducted in primary care settings that involved climate-related events as exposures, and health outcomes or utilization as study outcomes. Two reviewers independently screened and extracted relevant information from selected papers. Data were analysed using content analysis and presented using a narrative approach. Results We screened 693 non-duplicate papers, of those, 60 papers were analysed. Climate-related events were categorized by type, with outcomes described in terms of primary, secondary, and tertiary effects. Disruption of primary care often resulted from shortages in health resources. Primary care may be ill-prepared for climate-related events but has an important role in supporting the development of community. Conclusions Findings suggest various effects of climate-related events on primary care utilization and health outcomes in rural and remote areas. There is a need to prepare rural and remote primary care service before and after climate-related events.

AB  - Dicyandiamide decreased N2O emissions even under 40 degrees C.Ammonia oxidizers and nirS were well adapted to 40 degrees C in manured soils.Fungal nirK tolerated high temperature better in urea than manure treatment.Compared to nosZII, nosZI adapted to all temperature regardless of fertilization.nirS-denitrifier dominated N2O emissions at high temperature in fertilized soil.Heat waves associated with global warming and extreme climates would arouse serious consequences on nitrogen (N) cycle. However, the responses of the functional guilds to different temperatures, especially high temperature and the cascading effect on N2O emissions remain unclear. An incubation study was conducted to examine the effect of different temperatures (20 degrees C, 30 degrees C, and 40 degrees C) and fertilizer types (urea and manure) on N2O-producers and N2O-reducers, as well as the efficacy of dicyandiamide (DCD) on N2O emissions in a vegetable soil. Results showed that ammonia oxidizers and nirS-type denitrifiers were well adapted to high temperature (40 degrees C) with manure application, while the fungal nirK-denitrifiers had better tolerance with urea application. The nosZ clade I microbes had a strong adaptability to various temperatures regardless of fertilization type, while the growth of nosZ clade II group microbes in non-fertilized soil (control) were significantly inhibited at higher temperature. The N2O emissions were significantly decreased with increasing temperature and DCD application (up to 60%, even at 40 degrees C). Under high temperature conditions, fungal denitrifiers play a significant role in N-limited soils (non-fertilized) while nirS-type denitrifiers was more important in fertilized soils in N2O emissions, which should be specially targeted when mitigating N2O emissions under global warming climate.

AB  - Biofouling is the undesired deposition and growth of microorganisms on surfaces, forming biofilms. The definition is subjective and operational: not every biofilm causes biofouling - only if a given a subjective "threshold of interference" is exceeded, biofilms cause technical or medical problems. These range from the formation of slime layers on ship hulls or in pipelines, which increase friction resistance, to separation membranes, on which biofilms increase hydraulic resistance, to heat exchangers where they interfere with heat transport to contamination of treated water by eroded biofilm cells which may comprise hygienically relevant microorganisms, and, most dangerous, to biofilms on implants and catheters which can cause persistent infections. The largest fraction of anti-fouling research, usually in short-term experiments, is focused on prevention or limiting primary microbial adhesion. Intuitively, this appears only logical, but turns out mostly hopeless. This is because in technical systems with open access for microorganisms, all surfaces are colonized sooner or later which explains the very limited success of that research. As a result, the use of biocides remains the major tool to fight persistent biofilms. However, this is costly in terms of biocides, it stresses working materials, causes off-time and environmental damage and it usually leaves large parts of biofilms in place, ready for regrowth. In order to really solve biofouling problems, it is necessary to learn how to live with biofilms and mitigate their detrimental effects. This requires rather an integrated strategy than aiming to invent "one-shot" solutions. In this context, it helps to understand the biofilm way of life as a natural phenomenon. Biofilms are the oldest, most successful and most widely distributed form of life on earth, existing even in extreme environments and being highly resilient. Microorganisms in biofilms live in a self-produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) which allows them to develop emerging properties such as enhanced nutrient acquisition, synergistic microconsortia, enhanced tolerance to biocides and antibiotics, intense intercellular communication and cooperation. Transiently immobilized, biofilm organisms turn their matrix into an external digestion system by retaining complexed exoenzymes in the matrix. Biofilms grow even on traces of any biodegradable material, therefore, an effective anti-fouling strategy comprises to keep the system low in nutrients (good housekeeping), employing low-fouling, easy-to-clean surfaces, monitoring of biofilm development, allowing for early intervention, and acknowledging that cleaning can be more important than trying to kill biofilms, because cleaning does not cut the nutrient supply of survivors and dead biomass serves as an additional carbon source for "cannibalizing" survivors, supporting rapid after growth. An integrated concept is presented as the result of a long journey of the author through biofouling problems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and Objective: The present article has simulated to investigate the efficient hemodynamic parameters, the drug persistence, and drug distribution on an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
   Methods: Blood as a non-Newtonian fluid enters the artery acting as a real pulse waveform; its behavior is dependent on hematocrit and strain rate. In this simulation of computational fluid dynamic, magnetic nanoparticles of iron oxide which were in advance coated with the drug, are injected into the artery during a cardiac cycle. A two-phase model was applied to investigate the distribution of these carriers.
   Results: The results are presented for different hematocrits and the nanoparticle diameter. It is observed that hematocrit significantly affects drug persistence, so that lower hematocrit incites more accumulation of the drug in the dilatation part of the artery. The better drug accumulation is noticed, at the higher wall shear stress. Although no considerable impact on the flow pattern and wall shear stress was found with various nanoparticle diameters, the smaller size of the nanoparticles results in a greater amount of drug augmentation in the aneurysm wall output.
   Conclusions: At the higher hematocrit levels, the blood resistance to drug delivery increases throughout the artery. Also, the drug accumulates less on the aneurysm wall and stays longer on the aneurysm wall. On the contrary, the drug accumulates more by decreasing hematocrit level and stays shorter on the aneurysm wall. Moreover, the maximum drug concentration is observed at the lowest hematocrit level and nanoparticle diameter; also, the diameter of nanoparticles imposes no significant effect on the vor-ticity and wall shear stress. It is seen that the increment of the hematocrit level reduces the strength of vorticity and increases the amount of wall shear stress in the dilatation segment of the artery. The shear stress at three points of the dilatation wall is extreme, where the maximum density of nanoparticles occurs. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The success of deploying energy and water technologies in remote communities in developing countries can be improved by considering their synergistic relationships and their social, economic and environmental implications. This paper first evaluates social implications of current energy and water supply in a prototypical remote community against five future (2030) scenarios for synergistic provision of electricity, heat for cooking and water. This is followed by an integrated assessment of the social, environmental and economic life cycle sustainability through multicriteria decision analysis. The Business-as-usual (BAU) scenario shows high life cycle health impacts but low impacts from local air pollution. The contrary is true for the Independent and Advanced Independent scenarios which assume community self-sufficiency in energy and water supply. Greater access to electricity and water in the Advanced and Advanced Independent scenarios increases the potential for human development and security of supply, but there is an increase in the risk of accidents and decrease in social acceptability of the water supply. Similarly, a transition towards clean cooking fuels away from traditional solid biomass reduces local air pollution but increases reliance on imported fuels (BAU and Advanced scenarios). The Transition scenario is socially the most sustainable option, while Independent and Advanced Independent are the best options environmentally. They also have the lowest total operating costs, but have higher capital requirements than most other scenarios. Overall, unless extreme preferences for either environmental or social aspects are adopted, the Transition and Independent scenarios emerge as the most sustainable options. This suggests that current energy and water supply to remote communities can be transitioned sustainably to a self-sufficient system that does not depend on imported resources. The scenarios developed in this work present a framework for an integrated design and evaluation of energy and water supply in remote communities with the aim of aiding stakeholders in defining sustainable transition pathways.

AB  - The increasing global population and in-country migration have a significant impact on global land use land cover (LULC) change, which reduces green spaces and increases built-up areas altering the near-surface radiation and energy budgets, as well as the hydrological cycle over an urban area. The LULC change can lead to a combination of hazards such as increasing urban temperatures and intensified rainfall, ultimately resulting in increased flooding. This present study aims to discuss the changing pattern in urban temperature, daily rainfall, and flooding in Jakarta. The daily urban temperature and daily rainfall were based on a 30-year dataset from three meteorological stations of Jakarta in the period between 1987 and 2013. The changing trend was analyzed by using the Mann-Kendall and the Pettitt's tests. The relation between daily rainfall and flooding was analyzed using a 30-year flooding dataset collected from several sources including the international disaster database, research, and newspaper. The results show that there was an increasing trend in the daily temperature and the daily rainfall in Jakarta. The annual maximum daily temperature showed that an increasing trend started in 2001 at the KMY station, and in 1996 at the SHIA station. In general, the highest annual maximum daily temperature was about 37 degrees C, while the lowest was about 33 degrees C. Moreover, the maximum daily rainfall started increasing from 2001. An increase in the maximum daily rainfall was observed mainly in January and February, which coincided with the flood events recorded in these months in Jakarta. This indicates that Jakarta is not only vulnerable to high urban temperature but also to flooding. While these two hazards occur in distinct timeframes, there is potential for their convergence in the same geographical area. This study provides new and essential insights to enhance urban resilience and climate adaptation, advocating a holistic approach required to tackle these combined hazards.

AB  - Typhoon (TY) Haiyan was one of the most intense and highly destructive tropical cyclones (TCs) to affect the Philippines. As such, it is regarded as a baseline for extreme TC hazards. Improving the simulation of such TCs will not only improve the forecasting of intense TCs but will also be essential in understanding the potential sensitivity of future intense TCs with climate change. In this study, we investigate the effects of model configuration in simulating TY Haiyan using the Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) Model. Sensitivity experiments were conducted by systematically altering the choice of cumulus schemes, surface flux options, and spectral nudging. In addition to using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis fifth-generation (ERAS) single high-resolution realization as initial and boundary conditions, we also used 4 of the 10 lower-resolution ERAS data assimilation system (EDA) ensemble members as initial and boundary conditions. Results indicate a high level of sensitivity to cumulus schemes, with a tradeoff between using Kain-Fritsch and Tiedtke schemes that have not been mentioned in past studies of TCs in the Philippines. The Tiedtke scheme simulates the track better (with a lower mean direct positional error, DPE, of 33 km), while the Kain-Fritsch scheme produces stronger intensities (by 15 hPa minimum sea level pressure). Spectral nudging also resulted in a reduction in the mean DPE by 20 km, and varying the surface flux options resulted in the improvement of the simulated maximum sustained winds by up to 10 m s(-1). Simulations using the EDA members initial and boundary conditions revealed low sensitivity to the initial and boundary conditions, having less spread than the simulations using different parameterization schemes. We highlight the advantage of using an ensemble of cumulus parameterizations to take into account the uncertainty in the track and intensity of simulating intense tropical cyclones.

AB  - Styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) is a synthetic polymer primarily used in the tire industry, due to its good collaborative properties with additives and fillers. In the present work, we aim to synthesize an SBR composite reinforced with graphene oxide filler to be made biodegradable. In composite preparation, we fabricated styrene-butadiene rubber/graphene oxide/collagen (SBR/GO/COL) composites by adding a biodegradable biomolecule of elastin collagen fillers at 1.5 wt% and 2.5 wt%. Those prepared SBR/GO/COL composites, along with pure SBR and SBR/GO as control samples, were characterized using advanced analysis techniques, and their biodegradability was also evaluated. From microscopy examination results, the morphology of pure SBR had been improved after the addition of GO for SBR/GO composite by revealing a compact structure with a smoother surface. As for the SBR/GO/1.5COL sample, the 1.5 wt% COL filler was found to be effectively embedded in the SBR/GO matrix. However, the 2.5 wt% COL amount led to the formation of an aggregated structure in the SBR/GO/2.5COL sample due to the unreacted interface between COL filler and SBR/GO. The porosity had also been improved for SBR/GO/1.5COL sample, imparting it with a surface area suitable for tires in the automobile industry. From elemental analysis, the presence of nitrogen was detected for the collagen-filled SBR composite, proving the successful incorporation of collagen fibrils. The physicochemical analysis also detected a trace of graphene oxide and collagen functional groups in the SBR composite. In addition, the thermal analysis revealed those collagen-filled composites had stable heat tolerance behavior, which is suitably used in extreme weather conditions. Moreover, the SBR/GO/1.5COL sample exhibited good characteristics in both mechanical and biodegradable properties. Thus, the product of SBR/GO/1.5COL could be regarded as a promising composite for green tires in the auto industry in the future.

AB  - Climate change has increased frequency, severity and areal extent of droughts across the world in the last few decades magnifying their adverse impacts. Prediction of droughts is immensely helpful in early warning and preparing the most vulnerable communities to their adverse impacts. For the first time, this study investigated the potential of developing drought prediction models over Pakistan using three state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) techniques; Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and k-Nearest Neighbour (KNN). Three categories of droughts; moderate, severe, and extreme considering two major cropping seasons called Rabi and Kharif were estimated using Standardized Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI) and then predicted using the predictor data obtained from the National Centres for Environmental Prediction/National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis database. Also, for the first time in drought modelling, a novel feature selection approach called Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) was used for identifying optimum sets of predictors. In validation, SVM-based models were able to better capture the temporal and spatial characteristics of droughts over Pakistan compared to those by ANN and KNN-based models. KNN which was used in developing drought models for the first time displayed limited performance in comparison to that by SVM and ANN-based drought models, in validation. It was found that in the Rabi season SPEI is positively correlated with relative humidity over the Mediterranean Sea and the region north of the Caspian Sea. In the Kharif season, SPEI is positively correlated with the humid region over the south-eastern part of the Bay of Bengal and the regions north of the Mediterranean and Caspian Seas. In developing a drought prediction model for Pakistan, relative humidity, temperature and wind speed should be considered with a domain which encompasses the Mediterranean Sea, the region north of the Caspian Sea, the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea.

AB  - The Horn of Africa (HOA) is frequently plagued by severe droughts, significantly affecting food security, particularly in less developed and rapidly population-growing regions. This study aims to provide crucial insights into the long-term spatiotemporal patterns of drought and their impact on croplands in the HOA. The findings will contribute to developing effective early warning systems to mitigate drought-related risks, ensure sustainable water and food production and alleviate the consequences of droughts in the region. To achieve this, the study estimates the standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) for different time scales (3, 6 and 12 months). Over the previous 120 years (1901-2020), it examines the geographical and temporal trends of drought frequency, intensity, length, affected areas, and the extent of agricultural land impacted. The results reveal that moderate droughts of varying duration occur approximately once every 5 years throughout most of the HOA, while severe droughts occur once every 10 to 15 years. On the contrary, extreme droughts are predominantly observed in the eastern part of the HOA. The study also highlights a gradual decline in atmospheric water availability in the region. There has been increased rainfall variability in recent decades compared to the early twentieth century, leading to a rise in droughts. The analysis indicates a significant increase in 3-month droughts, particularly in the eastern part of the HOA, which historically has been more susceptible to droughts. Before 1940, HOA did not experience severe 3-month droughts, but they have become more common throughout the region since 1981. Similar trends have been observed for droughts of 6 and 12 months. Furthermore, the frequency of croplands affected by droughts of different durations has nearly doubled between 1981 and 2020 compared to 1901-1940. These findings shed light on the increasing risk of drought in the HOA and emphasise the need for proactive measures to address the challenges posed by droughts.

AB  - This paper aims to find out the effect of different weight percentages of geopolymer filler in glass-reinforced epoxy pipe, and which can achieve the best mechanical properties and adhesion between high calcium pozzolanic-based geopolymer matrices. Different weight percentages and molarities of epoxy hardener resin and high calcium pozzolanic-based geopolymer were injected into the glass fiber. By manually winding filaments, composite samples were produced, and they were then allowed to cure at room temperature. To determine how well the geopolymer matrices adhere to the fiber reinforcement, the microstructure of the composites' surfaces and perpendicular sections were examined. Maximum values of compressive strength and compressive modulus were 94.64 MPa and 2373.58 MPa, respectively, for the sample with a weight percentage of filler loading of 30 wt% for an alkali concentration of 12 M. This is a relatively wide range of geopolymer weight percentage of filler loading from 10 wt% to 40 wt%, at which we can obtain high compressive properties. By referring to microstructural analysis, adhesion, and interaction of the geopolymer matrix to glass fiber, it shows that the filler is well-dispersed and embedded at the fiber glass, and it was difficult to determine the differences within the range of optimal geopolymer filler content. By determining the optimum weight percent of 30 wt% of geopolymer filler and microstructural analysis, the maximum parameter has been achieved via analysis of high calcium pozzolanic-based geopolymer filler. Fire or elevated temperature represents one of the extreme ambient conditions that any structure may be exposed to during its service life. The heat resistance or thermal analysis between glass-reinforced epoxy (GRE) pipe and glass-reinforced epoxy pipe filled with high calcium pozzolanic-based geopolymer filler was studied by investigating burning tests on the samples, which shows that the addition of high calcium pozzolanic-based geopolymer filler results in a significant reduction of the melted epoxy.

AB  - Electric vehicles (EVs) offer a potential solution to face the global energy crisis and climate change issues in the transportation sector. Currently, lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries have gained popularity as a source of energy in EVs, owing to several benefits including higher power density. To compete with internal combustion (IC) engine vehicles, the capacity of Li-ion batteries is continuously increasing to improve the efficiency and reliability of EVs. The performance characteristics and safe operations of Li-ion batteries depend on their operating temperature which demands the effective thermal management of Li-ion batteries. The commercially employed cooling strategies have several obstructions to enable the desired thermal management of high-power density batteries with allowable maximum temperature and symmetrical temperature distribution. The efforts are striving in the direction of searching for advanced cooling strategies which could eliminate the limitations of current cooling strategies and be employed in next-generation battery thermal management systems. The present review summarizes numerous research studies that explore advanced cooling strategies for battery thermal management in EVs. Research studies on phase change material cooling and direct liquid cooling for battery thermal management are comprehensively reviewed over the time period of 2018-2023. This review discusses the various experimental and numerical works executed to date on battery thermal management based on the aforementioned cooling strategies. Considering the practical feasibility and drawbacks of phase change material cooling, the focus of the present review is tilted toward the explanation of current research works on direct liquid cooling as an emerging battery thermal management technique. Direct liquid cooling has the potential to achieve the desired battery performance under normal as well as extreme operating conditions. However, extensive research still needs to be executed to commercialize direct liquid cooling as an advanced battery thermal management technique in EVs. The present review would be referred to as one that gives concrete direction in the search for a suitable advanced cooling strategy for battery thermal management in the next generation of EVs.

AB  - To compare how different analytical methods explain crop yields from a long-term field experiment (LTFE), we analyzed the grain yield of winter wheat (WW) under different fertilizer applications in Muncheberg, Germany. An analysis of variance (ANOVA), linear mixed-effects model (LMM), and MP5 regression tree model were used to evaluate the grain yield response. All the methods identified fertilizer application and environmental factors as the main variables that explained 80% of the variance in grain yields. Mineral nitrogen fertilizer (NF) application was the major factor that influenced the grain yield in all methods. Farmyard manure slightly influenced the grain yield with no NF application in the ANOVA and M5P regression tree. While sources of environmental factors were unmeasured in the ANOVA test, they were quantified in detail in the LMM and M5P model. The LMM and M5P model identified the cumulative number of freezing days in December as the main climate-based determinant of the grain yield variation. Additionally, the temperature in October, the cumulative number of freezing days in February, the yield of the preceding crop, and the total nitrogen in the soil were determinants of the grain yield in both models. Apart from the common determinants that appeared in both models, the LMM additionally showed precipitation in June and the cumulative number of days in July with temperatures above 30 degrees C, while the M5P model showed soil organic carbon as an influencing factor of the grain yield. The ANOVA results provide only the main factors affecting the WW yield. The LMM had a better predictive performance compared to the M5P, with smaller root mean square and mean absolute errors. However, they were richer regressors than the ANOVA. The M5P model presented an intuitive visualization of important variables and their critical thresholds, and revealed other variables that were not captured by the LMM model. Hence, the use of different methods can strengthen the statement of the analysis, and thus, the co-use of the LMM and M5P model should be considered, especially in large databases involving multiple variables.

AB  - Climate change is one of the major global health threats to the world's population. It is brought on by global warming due in large part to increasing levels of greenhouse gases resulting from human activity, including burning fossil fuels (carbon dioxide), animal husbandry (methane from manure), industry emissions (ozone, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide), vehicle/factory exhaust, and chlorofluorocarbon aerosols that trap extra heat in the earth's atmosphere. Resulting extremes of weather give rise to wildfires, air pollution, changes in ecology, and floods. These in turn result in displacement of populations, family disruption, violence, and major impacts on water quality and availability, food security, public health and economic infrastructures, and limited abilities for civil society to maintain citizen safety. Climate change also has direct impacts on human health and well-being. Particularly vulnerable populations are affected, including women, pregnant women, children, the disabled, and the elderly, who comprise the majority of the poor globally. Additionally, the effects of climate change disproportionally affect disadvantaged communities, including low income and communities of color, and lower-income countries that are at highest risk of adverse impacts when disasters occur due to inequitable distribution of resources and their socioeconomic status. The climate crisis is tilting the risk balance unfavorably for women's sexual and reproductive health and rights as well as newborn and child health. Obstetrician/gynecologists have the unique opportunity to raise awareness, educate, and advocate for mitigation strategies to reverse climate change affecting our patients and their families. This article puts climate change in the context of women's reproductive health as a public health issue, a social justice issue, a human rights issue, an economic issue, a political issue, and a gender issue that needs our attention now for the health and well-being of this and future generations. FIGO joins a broad coalition of international researchers and the medical community in stating that the current climate crisis presents an imminent health risk to pregnant people, developing fetuses, and reproductive health, and recognizing that we need society-wide solutions, government policies, and global cooperation to address and reduce contributors, including fossil fuel production, to climate change.

AB  - It is reported in this study a new approach for modulation and even suppression of the electroosmotic flow (EOF) to achieve better electrokinetic preconcentration in capillary electrophoresis. This is based on the augmentation of the buffer?s concentrations to very high levels (more than a thousand of mM) without recourse to any dynamic/permanent coating nor viscous gel. The use of large weakly charged molecules as background electrolyte?s constituents allows working at extreme concentration ranges without penalty of high electric currents and Joule heating. By this way, the electroosmotic mobility could be modulated over a wide range (2e60 x 10-5 cm2 V-1 s-1 under alkaline conditions), and suppressed to levels equivalent to those obtained with several neutral coatings. The highest buffer concentrations, and the lowest EOF magnitudes, accordingly, were achieved with diethanolamine/3(Cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid (ionic strength (IS) of 250 mM, pH 9.5), Tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (Tris)/2-(Cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid (CHES) (IS of 280 mM, pH 8.7) and triethanolamine/2-(Cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid (IS of 250 mM, pH 8.5). For demonstration, this new approach was applied for sensitive determination of core-shell magnetic nanoparticles (CSMNPs) having high potential for healthcare applications such as imaging agents for diagnostics and controllable cargos for nanomedicine. Different profiles were achieved for purpose-made and commercial magnetic nanoparticles using CE coupled with light-emitting-diode induced fluorescence (LEDIF) detection. The & nbsp;best performance for EOF-assisted preconcentration and CE-LEDIF of CSMNPs was achieved with these nanoparticles prepared in TRIS/CHES (IS 10 mM, pH 8.4) for preconcentration, and separation under BGE of TRIS/CHES (IS 100 mM, pH 8.4). Compared to the conventional capillary electrophoresis (CE-UV) method for characterization of magnetic nanoparticles, our proposed approach with fluorescent detection and EOF-assisted preconcentration offers almost 350-fold sensitivity improvement. Furthermore, our scheme can be used for monitoring the interaction between CSMNPs and target pharmaceutical molecules, serving for drug delivery development. A preliminary study with two antibiotics using this approach revealed that kanamycin interacts better with the target nanoparticles than amikacin.& nbsp; (C)& nbsp;& nbsp;2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Previous research has revealed that nanofluids are capable of improving the heat transfer perfor-mance of energy systems. Researchers devote a considerable deal of attention to multi-walled carbon nanotubes owing to their exceptional features, like superior thermal conductivity. By adding COOH functional groups to multi wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), the carbon nanotubes become hydrophilic, hence enhancing the sta-bility of nanofluids.Methods: In this investigation, nanoparticles were characterized using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Bru-nauer-Emmett-Teller (BET). The durational effects of sonication on three distinct nanofluid concentrations (0.3, 0.1, and 0.05 vol.%) generated with functionalized-multi walled carbon nanotubes (f-MWCNTs/water) on thermal conductivity were also examined. After 80 minutes of sonication, a volume concentration of 0.10 vol% exhibits the best stable long-term value (39.84 mV) based on the findings of studies. As sonication duration increases, particle size decreases, and the 0.30 vol% concentration changes significantly. At a temperature of 50 degrees C and a sonication period of 20 minutes, the largest increase in thermal conductivity was 5.90% at a con-centration of 0.10 vol %. The experimental data acquired through extensive lab-based testing was employed for the development of the meta-model. A modern machine learning technique i.e., extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) has been employed to model-predict the effects of sonication on thermal conductivity. A contempo-rary machine learning method Gaussian process regression (GPR) was employed for comparative analysis.Significant findings: The optimal sonication time and long-term stability were determined to be 0.10 vol.% con-centration and 80 minutes. All samples remained stable for up to two months during the examination. With proper sonication time and at 0.10 vol.%, improved dispersions and characteristics were obtained. The XGBoost-based model outperformed the GPR-based framework in terms of both reduced errors and greater correlation values. The coefficient of determination (R2) of the XGBoost-based model was observed to be 5.45% higher than that of the GPR-based model.

AB  - For the past ten years, there has been a trend toward strengthening polymer composites with the help of natural fibers derived from plant and animal sources, which has led to ecological imbalance. Hence, to maintain the ecological balancing factors, the researchers and industrial experts are concentrating on the reinforcement of naturally available mineral materials in polymer products to minimize the polymer percentage and boost the economic feasibility of products with lightweight properties. In fact, incorporating basalt mineral into different polymer matrices is a highly creative notion that might open up some very interesting, uncharted territory. Basalt helps to create a pollution-free environment and balance ecological challenges by reducing the polymer ratio in the objects without many changes in their core properties. Basalt is desirable because of its outstanding thermal and mechanical characteristics, simplicity of processing, affordability, and lack of toxicity. Concerning these points, the current study aims to fabricate mineral particles (basalt)-reinforced (30 wt%) different polymers (synthetic epoxy, bio-epoxy, polyester, vinyl ester, polylactic acid, polypropylene, and high-density polyethylene) composite for lightweight thermal applications. The casting technique was used for the fabrication of thermoset polymer composites, whereas compression molding was employed to fabricate thermoplastic composites after an internal mixing process. The fabricated composites are subjected to thermogravimetric, thermomechanical, and dynamic mechanical analysis to analyze the thermal stability of the resultant composites. The Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that most of the samples exhibited good thermal stability with the addition of 30 wt% basalt fillers. As a result of moisture content as well as certain volatile compounds, if any, only a minimal weight loss in the range of 30 degrees C to 130 degrees C was seen at the early phase of heating for all neat and composite samples. The Thermomechanical analysis findings showed that basalt reinforcement at 30 wt% in synthetic epoxy, Polylactic acid, Polypropylene, and High Density Poly Ethylene polymers causes a reduction in dimensional variations up to 70 degrees C. This is because the basalt particles, particularly in the hard glassy area, limit the passage of molecules at lower temperatures. The higher stiffness of the basalt particles has significantly contributed to the viscoelastic properties of all the thermoset and thermoplastic composites. Because of the extreme closeness and thick packing of the components, which are in a dormant condition, the glassy areas in particular have a greater storage modulus.

AB  - The spatial and temporal dynamics of daily ultraviolet index (UVI) for a period of 18 years (2004-2022) over the Indian state of Kerala were statistically characterised in the study. The UVI measurements used for the study were derived from the ultraviolet-B (UVB) irradiance measured by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) of the AURA satellite and classified into different severity levels for analysis. Basic statistics of daily, monthly and seasonal UVI as well as Mann-Kendall (MK) statistical trend characteristics and the rate of change of daily UVI using Theil-Sen's slope test were also evaluated. A higher variability of UVI characteristics was observed in the Kerala region, and more than 79% of the measurements fell into the categories of very high and extreme UVI values, which suggests the need of implementation of appropriate measures to reduce health risks. Although the UVI measured during the study period shows a slight decrease, most of the data show a seasonal variation with undulating low and peak values. Higher UVI are observed during the months of March, April and September. The region also has higher UVI during the southwest monsoon (SWM) and summer seasons. Although Kerala region as a single whole unit, UVI show a non-significant decreasing trend (-0.83), the MK test revealed the increasing and decreasing trends of UVI ranging from -1.96 to 0.41 facilitated the delineation of areas (domains) where UVI are increasing or decreasing. The domain of UVI increase occupies the central and southern (S) parts, and the domains of decrease cover the northern (N) and S parts of the Kerala region. The rate of change of daily UVI in domain of increase and decrease shows an average rate of 0.34 x 10-5 day-1 and -2 x 10-5 day-1, respectively. The parameters (rainfall, air temperature, cloud optical depth (COD) and solar zenith angle (SZA)) that affect the strength of UV rays reaching the surface indicate that a cloud-free atmosphere or low thickness clouds prevails in the Kerala region. Overall, the study results indicate the need for regular monitoring of UVI in the study area and also suggest appropriate campaigns to disseminate information and precautions for prolonged UVI exposure to reduce the adverse health effects, since the study area has a high population density.

AB  - Thermal manipulation (TM) of incubation temperature has been demonstrated to alter metabolism and post-hatch thermotolerance in broiler strains (meat-type chickens). Fewer reports were focused on layer-type chickens and there was no report on amino acid metabolism during TM in layer-type embryos. In this study, we investigated the effects of TM on embryonic development, hepatic amino acid metabolism, and hatching performance in layer-type chickens. Fertilized eggs were incubated under control thermoneutral temperature (CT, 37.6 degrees C) and TM with high temperature (TMH, 39 degrees C, 8 h/day) or low temperature (TML, 20 degrees C, 1 h/day) from embryonic day (ED) 8 to ED 15. The embryonic weight and relative embryonic weight (yolk-free embryonic weight to the initial egg weight) significantly declined in the TML group at ED 13 (P < 0.01) and ED 16 (P < 0.0001), and were significantly increased (P < 0.001) in the TMH group at ED 16, in comparison with the embryos in the CT group. The concentrations of all hepatic free amino acids were significantly increased (P < 0.01) with embryonic development. Interestingly, TMH and TML caused similar effects on hepatic amino acid metabolism, in which most of the essential and non-essential amino acids were significantly declined (P < 0.05) under TM treatments at ED 13 but not affected at ED 16. Until hatching, TML, but not TMH, caused a significant (P < 0.05) delay (31-38 min/day from ED 8) in incubation duration. The hatchability in the TML group was lower than the other two groups, which indicated that 20 degrees C as cold stimulation was not suitable for layer embryos. The body weight, yolk weight, yolk-free body mass, and chick quality were not affected by TM treatments. However, the relative weight of the liver, but not the heart, was significantly reduced (P < 0.05) at hatching by TML treatment. In conclusion, TML, but not TMH, caused to delay in embryogenesis and affected the internal organ of chicks at hatch. Similar changes in amino acid metabolism under TMH and TML indicated that thermal stress induced by both high and low extreme ambient temperatures influences embryonic amino acid metabolism in a similar fashion in layer-type embryos.

AB  - Climate change and human activities have profoundly affected the world with extreme precipitation, heat waves, water scarcity, frequent floods and intense droughts. It is acknowledged that climate change will persist and perhaps intensify in the future, and it is thus meaningful to explore the quantitative impacts of these changes on hydrological regimes. The Jiulong River basin serves as an important watershed on the southeast coast of China. However, future hydrological changes under the combined impacts of climate change and land use change have been barely investigated. In this study, the climate outputs from five general circulation models (GCMs) under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) were corrected and spatially downscaled by a statistical downscaling method combining quantile mapping and machine learning. The future high-resolution land use maps were projected by the CA-Markov model with land use changes from the Land-Use Harmonization 2 (LUH2) as constraints. The future dynamic vegetation process was projected by the Biome-GBC model, and then, the future hydrological process under four representative concentration pathways and shared socioeconomic pathways (RCP-SSP) combined scenarios was simulated by a distributed hydrological model. Based on the copula method, the flood frequency and corresponding return periods were derived. The results demonstrated that future precipitation and air temperature would continue to rise, and future land use changes would have different developing pathways determined by the designs in various SSP-RCPs. Under the combined impacts of climate and land use change, the total available water resources will increase due to increasing precipitation, and the high flow and low flow will both increase at three stations under the four SSP-RCPs. The annual 1-day maximum discharge is projected to increase by 67-133% in the last decade of the 21st century, and the annual 7-day minimum discharge is projected to increase by 19-39%. The flood frequency analysis showed that the Jiulong River basin would face more frequent floods in the future. By the end of the 21st century, the station-average frequency of a historical 100-year flood will increase by 122% under the most optimistic scenario (SSP126) and increase by 213% under the scenario of greatest regional rivalry (SSP370). We demonstrated that climate change would be the major cause for the increase in future high flows and that land use change would dominate future changes in low flows. Finally, we recommend integrated and sustainable water management systems to tackle future challenges in this coastal basin.

AB  - This study presents an approach to synthesizing a mathematical model for determining the composition of geopolymer foams. The focus is on improving the accuracy of multi-criteria optimization for metakaolin-based geopolymer composite composition. Experimental data on the physical and mechanical properties of geopolymers are digitized to establish the computational basis for these calculations. Optimization criteria include density, porosity, compressive strength, flexural strength, Young's modulus, volumetric heat capacity, thermal diffusivity, and thermal conductivity. In addition, parameters such as shrinkage, processability, adsorption, adhesion, and economic aspects are also considered. The proposed format aims to fine-tune the geopolymer composite formulation by using the developed model for multi-criteria analysis of technological and physical-mechanical properties of foamed geopolymer composite materials (FGCM). A synthesis of mathematical models including the main criterion, suboptimization, generalized criterion, lexicographic optimization, sorting of alternatives, interval values, and decision tree methods was used to develop methods for multi-criteria optimization of the composition of foamed geopolymers. The study additionally uses the method of criteria convolution, in which the indices of specific criteria are modified in the form of a ratio scale to clarify the limits and boundaries of changes in the composition of the geopolymer mixture. This minimizes contradictory conclusions and expert opinions and highlights the extreme values for each group of parameters. By filtering the raw information, the accuracy of estimates is improved. The exclusivity of the proposed model for determining the composition of foamed geopolymers lies in the possibility of selecting the necessary formulation by mathematical processing of digitized information of the results of measurements of physical-mechanical and operational-technological properties according to the proposed innovative algorithms and schemes. Compared to existing methods, the focus of the proposed method allows for solving problems that are inaccessible to direct observation. This is due to the discovery of hidden information about the interaction of structural and strength parameters. Combining subjective and objective elements of the choice of the optimal geopolymer formulation, the proposed methodology of information processing allows for improving the quality of determining the optimal composition of the geopolymer mixture. The results of multicriteria optimization for foamed geopolymer indicate that the optimal component composition of the geopolymer matrix, within the selected range of variation, consists of 100g metakaolin, 90g potassium activator, 5g silica fume, 100g silica sand, 7g basalt fiber, and 3g aluminum. These proportions yield the best mechanical, thermal, and technological properties.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Typically, waste glass industry contributes to various harmful environmental impacts. Glass manufacturing relies on considerably extreme temperature values. 22 million tons in Europe and 95 million tons of carbon dioxide are generated globally per annum. Meantime, scholars noted that million tons of waste glass produced worldwide yearly could cause elevated levels of water and air pollution due to the accumulation of waste glass in landfills. In this setting, researchers dedicated numerous efforts to create feasible strategies and active solutions to alleviate all these significant numbers. One of those solutions is the waste glass recycling. It is reported that recycling waste glass provides efficient air pollution and water contamination mitigation by roughly 20% and 50%, respectively. One sector that took into account this valuable idea is the concrete industry. Scientists discovered that substituting specific ratios of cement/ sand with waste glass (including 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90%) in concrete could achieve substantial added values in terms of mechanical properties, such as better durability, abrasion resistance, flexural strength, compressive strength, and splitting tensile strength. Few, at the same time, found that adding waste glass into concrete could reduce facilities' cooling and heating loads due to the decline in the concrete's thermal conductivity. Nonetheless, the available literature lacks adequate proofs associated with this fact. Additionally, different peer-reviewed articles did not address the application of this concept on Ultra-High Performance Concrete (UHPC) but on regular concrete. To bridge this knowledge gap, this manuscript is guided to provide more databases on the influence of cement/ sand replacement with waste glass on concrete's thermal characteristics yet paying special attention on UHPC. A comprehensive review is implemented in this context to shed light on these aspects. Based on the thorough review carried out in this article, the outcomes revealed that employing waste glass in concrete and UHPC could attain multiple advantages, like (i) Enhancing variant UHPC and concrete's mechanical properties (containing split tensile strength, compressive strength, compaction, durability, flexural strength, bulk density, and shrinkage resistance), (ii) fostering thermal conductivity and thermal resistance, helping make the building of this new concrete mix more energy efficient, (iii) minimizing glass industry's adverse environmental effect, (iii) preserving natural resources, and (iv) reducing the overall budget of UHPC production. However, it is crucial to conduct further experimental and numerical analyses on waste glass replacement with concrete to offer more pieces of evidences and facts of the importance of waste glass replacement in boosting UHPC thermal performance in small and large-scale facilities.

AB  - The characterization and visualization of multiphase flows are significant for advancing thermal-hydraulics and nuclear engineering research, such as the safety and efficacy of nuclear reactor operation, etc. Neutron imaging technique has been established as a non-invasive measurement technique with high accuracy and reliability for multiphase flow study to provide a visual knowledge of the distribution of characteristics within thermalhydraulics systems under determination. Various information can be extracted and quantified from neutron images for further analysis, such as flow patterns, void fraction distribution, bubble coalescence and breakup, bubble velocity, pressure loss, gas volume fraction, and effects of rising bubbles. Two-dimensional Neutron Radiography (NR) is produced by measuring an amount of transmitted neutron intensity after passing through a test section. This modality of imaging has been successfully utilized for visualization and quantification purposes in many applications and multiphase flow studies such as geological and porous media research, thermalhydraulics phenomena, etc. However, certain shortcomings of two-dimensional NR are prominent, including limited temporal and spatial resolutions, which result in challenges in evaluating materials with complex geometries and capturing the high-speed fluid flow and dynamic phenomena. Three-dimensional Neutron Computed Tomography (NCT) provides a clearer insight into an object and a capability to observe dynamic phenomena. The CT technique is based on a measurement of radiation attenuation in a projection through an object from different orientations. Two main types of reconstruction algorithms are analytical reconstruction algorithms and iterative reconstruction algorithms. The analytical reconstruction algorithm provides accurate reconstruction without requiring long computational time and a high level of complexity. However, it requires a fully sampled projection data set with an angle coverage of 360 degrees around the object, which is not always feasible to obtain under extreme experimental environments such as high heat, physical stress, and intense radiation. An investigation of multiphase flow studies in neutron imaging facilities encounters the mentioned environments, limited access, and high cost of implementation. Therefore, a research direction in NCT reconstruction methods lies in a trade-off between many projections with a low number of counts against a reduction in projections but increased acquisition time per orientation angle. Iterative reconstruction techniques produce improved image quality with a smaller amount of projection data. Nevertheless, the techniques exhibit increased computing complexity and longer computational time. This study reviews recent studies of NR and NCT in multiphase flow applications, such as an investigation of heavy oil flow behaviors for upgrading a packed bed of metallic reactors and determination of flow regime and void fraction distribution, etc. In addition, this study presents an in-depth explanation of iterative reconstruction algorithms and discusses the direction in which the NCT study is gradually shifting.
