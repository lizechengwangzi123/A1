AB  - Gaseous emissions have contributed to global warming, an increase in the 
      frequency of extreme weather events and poorer air quality. The associated health 
      impacts have been well reported in temperate regions. In Singapore, key climate 
      change adaptation measures and activities include coastal and flood protection, 
      and mitigating heat impacts. We systematically reviewed studies examining climate 
      variability and air quality with population health in Singapore, a tropical 
      city-state in South-East Asia (SEA), with the aim to identify evidence gaps for 
      policymakers. We included 14 studies with respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular 
      outcomes, foodborne disease and dengue. Absolute humidity (3 studies) and 
      rainfall (2 studies) were positively associated with adverse health. Extreme heat 
      (2 studies) was inversely associated with adverse health. The effects of mean 
      ambient temperature and relative humidity on adverse health were inconsistent. 
      Nitrogen dioxide and ozone were positively associated with adverse health. 
      Climate variability and air quality may have disease-specific, differing 
      directions of effect in Singapore. Additional high quality studies are required 
      to strengthen the evidence for policymaking. Research on effective climate action 
      advocacy and adaptation measures for community activities should be strengthened.

TI  - Impacts of and adaptation to climate change on the oil palm in Malaysia: a 
      systematic review.
PG  - 54339-54361

AB  - The interaction and the interplay of climate change with oil palm production in 
      the Southeast Asia region are of serious concern. This particularly applies in 
      Malaysia due to its rank as the second largest palm oil producer in the world. 
      The anthropogenic activities and the agroecological practices in oil palm 
      plantation, including excessive use of fertilisers, bush fire due to land 
      clearing, and cultivation on peatland, have exacerbated the effects of climate 
      change featuring extreme events, drought, flooding, heatwave, as well as 
      infestation of pest and diseases. These adverse impacts on oil palm production 
      highlight the significance of deploying effective adaptation strategies. The 
      study aims to examine the impact of climate change on oil palm production and 
      identify the farmers' adaptation strategies to the impacts of climate change in 
      Malaysia. This study was conducted a comprehensive review of the articles 
      published from 2000 to 2021 in the contexts of climate change and oil palm 
      production in Malaysia. The review shows that climate change has a range of 
      impacts on the oil palm production in Malaysia. As a result, several adaptation 
      options were identified, such as breeding of hybrid varieties that are tolerant 
      and resistant to heat; sustainable management of soil; pit and tranches to 
      enhance water management in plantation areas; minimal use of fertilisers, 
      herbicides, and pesticides; zero burning; and minimum tillage. The reviewed 
      studies recommended the following to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate 
      change: sustainable national policy on climate change, conservation of the 
      existing carbon stock, effective management of tropical rainforest biodiversity, 
      afforestation for carbon sequestration, and reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) 
      emission.

TI  - Urban heat mitigation by green and blue infrastructure: Drivers, effectiveness, 
      and future needs.

AB  - The combination of urbanization and global warming leads to urban overheating and 
      compounds the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events due to climate 
      change. Yet, the risk of urban overheating can be mitigated by urban 
      green-blue-grey infrastructure (GBGI), such as parks, wetlands, and engineered 
      greening, which have the potential to effectively reduce summer air temperatures. 
      Despite many reviews, the evidence bases on quantified GBGI cooling benefits 
      remains partial and the practical recommendations for implementation are unclear. 
      This systematic literature review synthesizes the evidence base for heat 
      mitigation and related co-benefits, identifies knowledge gaps, and proposes 
      recommendations for their implementation to maximize their benefits. After 
      screening 27,486 papers, 202 were reviewed, based on 51 GBGI types categorized 
      under 10 main divisions. Certain GBGI (green walls, parks, street trees) have 
      been well researched for their urban cooling capabilities. However, several other 
      GBGI have received negligible (zoological garden, golf course, estuary) or 
      minimal (private garden, allotment) attention. The most efficient air cooling was 
      observed in botanical gardens (5.0 ± 3.5°C), wetlands (4.9 ± 3.2°C), green walls 
      (4.1 ± 4.2°C), street trees (3.8 ± 3.1°C), and vegetated balconies (3.8 ± 2.7°C). 
      Under changing climate conditions (2070-2100) with consideration of RCP8.5, there 
      is a shift in climate subtypes, either within the same climate zone (e.g., Dfa to 
      Dfb and Cfb to Cfa) or across other climate zones (e.g., Dfb [continental 
      warm-summer humid] to BSk [dry, cold semi-arid] and Cwa [temperate] to Am 
      [tropical]). These shifts may result in lower efficiency for the current GBGI in 
      the future. Given the importance of multiple services, it is crucial to balance 
      their functionality, cooling performance, and other related co-benefits when 
      planning for the future GBGI. This global GBGI heat mitigation inventory can 
      assist policymakers and urban planners in prioritizing effective interventions to 
      reduce the risk of urban overheating, filling research gaps, and promoting 
      community resilience.

      two decades of systematic review of observational studies.

AB  - Extreme weather events in South and Southeast Asia exert profound psychosocial 
      impacts, amplifying the prevalence of mental illness. Despite their substantial 
      consequences, there is a dearth of research and representation in the current 
      literature. We conducted a systematic review of observational studies published 
      between January 1, 2000, and January 20, 2024, to examine the impact of extreme 
      weather events on the mental health of the South and Southeast Asian population. 
      Quality assessment of the included studies was conducted using the 
      Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) quality appraisal checklist. The search retrieved 70 
      studies that met the inclusion criteria and were included in our review. Most 
      were from India (n = 22), and most used a cross-sectional study design (n = 55). 
      Poor mental health outcomes were associated with six types of extreme weather 
      events: floods, storm surges, typhoons, cyclones, extreme heat, and riverbank 
      erosion. Most studies (n = 41) reported short-term outcome measurements. Findings 
      included outcomes with predictable symptomatology, including post-traumatic 
      stress disorder, depression, anxiety, general psychological distress, emotional 
      distress and suicide. Limited studies on long-term effects showed higher mental 
      disorders after floods and typhoons, while cyclone-exposed individuals had more 
      short-term distress. Notably, the review identified over 50 risk factors 
      influencing mental health outcomes, categorized into six classes: demographic, 
      economic, health, disaster exposure, psychological, and community factors. 
      However, the quantitative evidence linking extreme weather events to mental 
      health was limited due to a lack of longitudinal data, lack of control groups, 
      and the absence of objective exposure measurements. The review found some 
      compelling evidence linking extreme weather events to adverse mental health in 
      the South and Southeast Asia region. Future research should focus on longitudinal 
      study design to identify the specific stressors and climatic factors influencing 
      the relationship between climate extremes and mental health in this region.

TI  - Insights into morphological and physio-biochemical adaptive responses in mungbean 
      (Vigna radiata L.) under heat stress.

AB  - Mungbean (Vigna radiata L. Wilczek) is an important food legume crop which 
      contributes significantly to nutritional and food security of South and Southeast 
      Asia. The crop thrives in hot and humid weather conditions, with an optimal 
      temperature range of 28°-35°C, and is mainly cultivated under rainfed 
      environments. However, the rising global temperature has posed a serious threat 
      to mungbean cultivation. Optimal temperature is a vital factor in cellular 
      processes, and every crop species has evolved with its specific temperature 
      tolerance ability. Moreover, variation within a crop species is inevitable, given 
      the diverse environmental conditions under which it has evolved. For instance, 
      various mungbean germplasm can grow and produce seeds in extreme ambient 
      temperatures as low as 20°C or as high as 45°C. This range of variation in 
      mungbean germplasm for heat tolerance plays a crucial role in developing heat 
      tolerant and high yielding mungbean cultivars. However, heat tolerance is a 
      complex mechanism which is extensively discussed in this manuscript; and at the 
      same time individual genotypes have evolved with various ways of heat stress 
      tolerance. Therefore, to enhance understanding towards such variability in 
      mungbean germplasm, we studied morphological, anatomical, physiological, and 
      biochemical traits which are responsive to heat stress in plants with more 
      relevance to mungbean. Understanding heat stress tolerance attributing traits 
      will help in identification of corresponding regulatory networks and associated 
      genes, which will further help in devising suitable strategies to enhance heat 
      tolerance in mungbean. The major pathways responsible for heat stress tolerance 
      in plants are also discussed.
