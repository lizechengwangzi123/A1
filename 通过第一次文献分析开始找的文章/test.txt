   abstract = {Tropical cities are experiencing rapid growth but lack routine air pollution monitoring to develop prescient air quality policies. Here, we conduct targeted sampling of recent (2000s to 2010s) observations of air pollutants from space-based instruments over 46 fast-growing tropical cities. We quantify significant annual increases in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) (1 to 14%), ammonia (2 to 12%), and reactive volatile organic compounds (1 to 11%) in most cities, driven almost exclusively by emerging anthropogenic sources rather than traditional biomass burning. We estimate annual increases in urban population exposure to air pollutants of 1 to 18% for fine particles (PM2.5) and 2 to 23% for NO2 from 2005 to 2018 and attribute 180,000 (95% confidence interval: -230,000 to 590,000) additional premature deaths in 2018 (62% increase relative to 2005) to this increase in exposure. These cities are predicted to reach populations of up to 80 million people by 2100, so regulatory action targeting emerging anthropogenic sources is urgently needed.},

   abstract = {Malaysia is highly depending on fossil fuel to produce electricity. Undesirably, the excessive usage of fossil fuels releases harmful gases which can cause serious environmental problems. A potential solution to curb the fossil fuel consumption and environmental problems is the utilization of renewable energy such as solar energy. Malaysia has abundant solar energy resources throughout the year due to its location near to equator, promises the highest beneficial in using solar energy for technology development such as solar water heater (SWH). However, people in Malaysia are not aware of SWH's benefits due to high initial installation cost of SWH. Thus, this study presents financial evaluation of SWH in Malaysia which takes into account cost benefit and payback period of using SWH. The benefits are reanalysed bases on annual effective solar radiation. The result reveals that the utilization of a SWH can save up to RM 704 of energy cost per year. The payback periods of a SWH in Malaysia vary from 7.4 to 10.7 years, depending on the initial installation cost of SWH. Promoting the use of SWH by all EWH's owners in Malaysia can save 2 billion kWh of electricity and notably prevent emissions of 1,560,370 t CO2, 11,830 t SO2, and 4930 t NOx per year.},

Although several quantification of the extremities of a heatwave have been proposed in literature, they are mostly improvised and there does not exist a universally accepted definition of heatwave. In this article, we devise a probabilistic inferential framework to characterize heatwave and come up with a definition that can capture the essence of all existing ad hoc definitions. We derive an exact distribution on the frequency of such durations for a stationary Markov process and also an approximate distribution of durations for a stationary non-Markov time series. For a given site, using a daily time series (of ambient temperature or heat-index), we define a heatwave as the number of sustained days above a given threshold using the probability distribution of the durations. We illustrate the proposed methodology using daily time series of ambient temperature for a fixed site (of Atlanta) and also using the USCRN consisting of 126 sites across the United States. Furthermore, we also derive an empirical quadratic curve based relationship between expected durations and extreme thresholds. The proofs of the theorems, datasets, algorithms, and computer codes are provided in the supplementary materials.},

   abstract = {Background: Heatwaves affect human health and global heatwave-related disease burden will continue to rise as climate change proceeds, but the effects of heatwaves on cardiovascular and respiratory diseases have not yet been investigated globally and nationally. Objectives: This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to quantify heatwave effects on four major health outcomes: cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity and mortality. Methods: We searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science for relevant studies from database inception to November 2018. Categories of morbidity included hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and ambulance attendances/call-outs. A random-effects meta-analysis model was used to pool previous estimates of heatwave effects on mortality and morbidity due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Subgroup analyses by gender, age, and disease cause were conducted. Sensitivity analyses were performed by the categories of morbidity, heatwave definitions, study design, and using a leave-one-out cross validation approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO (number: CRD42018101964). Results: We identified 54 studies conducted in 20 countries. In total, there were significant associations between heatwaves and cardiovascular mortality (risk estimates (RE): 1.149, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.090, 1.210) and respiratory mortality (RE: 1.183, 95%CI: 1.092, 1.282), but the magnitude of these associations varied across countries and studies. Heatwaves appeared to be marginally associated with cardiovascular and respiratory morbidities (RE: 0.999, 95%CI: 0.996, 1.002, p-value = 0.61 for cardiovascular morbidity; RE: 1.043, 95%CI: 0.995, 1.093; p-value = 0.08 for respiratory morbidity). For mortality, significant associations were observed for the elderly, ischemic heart disease, stroke, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Sensitivity analyses suggested that these findings were robust. Conclusion: Mortality of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases appeared to be more vulnerable to heatwaves in comparison to morbidity. Considering high heterogeneity detected between studies and limited investigations into subpopulations, more research are required to provide a clearer picture of how heatwaves affect cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in different settings.},

   abstract = {Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are periods of extreme warm sea surface temperature that persist for days to months1 and can extend up to thousands&nbsp;of kilometres2. Some of the recently observed marine heatwaves revealed the high vulnerability of marine ecosystems3–11 and fisheries12–14 to such extreme climate events. Yet our knowledge about past occurrences15 and the future progression of MHWs is very limited. Here we use satellite observations and a suite of Earth system model simulations to show that MHWs have already become longer-lasting and more frequent, extensive and intense in the past few decades, and that this trend will accelerate under further global warming. Between 1982 and 2016, we detect a doubling in the number of MHW days, and this number is projected to further increase on average by a factor of 16 for global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius relative to preindustrial levels and by a factor of 23 for global warming of 2.0 degrees Celsius. However, current national policies for the reduction of global carbon emissions are predicted to result in global warming of about 3.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the twenty-first century16, for which models project an average increase in the probability of MHWs by a factor of 41. At this level of warming, MHWs have an average spatial extent that is 21 times bigger than in preindustrial times, last on average 112 days and reach maximum sea surface temperature anomaly intensities of 2.5&nbsp;degrees Celsius. The largest changes are projected to occur in the western tropical Pacific and Arctic oceans. Today, 87 per cent of MHWs are attributable to human-induced warming, with this ratio increasing to nearly 100 per cent under any global warming scenario exceeding 2 degrees Celsius. Our results suggest that MHWs will become very frequent and extreme under global warming, probably pushing marine organisms and ecosystems to the limits of their resilience and even beyond, which could cause irreversible changes. Satellite observations and Earth system model simulations reveal that marine heatwaves have increased in recent decades and will increase further in terms of frequency, intensity, duration and spatial extent.},

   abstract = {Heatwaves are extended periods of unusually high temperatures with significant societal and environmental impacts. Despite their significance, there is not a generalized definition for heatwaves. In this paper, we introduce a multi-method global heatwave and warm-spell data record and analysis toolbox (named GHWR). In addition to a comprehensive long-term global data record of heatwaves, GHWR allows processing and extracting heatwave records for any location efficiently. We use traditional constant temperature threshold methods, as well as spatially and temporally localized threshold approaches to identify heatwaves. GHWR includes binary (0/1) occurrence records of heatwaves/warm-spells, and annual summary files with detailed information on their frequency, duration, magnitude and amplitude. GHWR also introduces the standardized heat index (SHI) as a generalized statistical metric to identify heatwave/warm-spells. SHI has direct association with the probability distribution function of long-term daily temperatures for any given calendar day and spatial grid. Finally, GHWR offers a unique opportunity for users to select the type of heatwave/warm-spell information from a plethora of methods based on their needs and applications.

Over a relatively short period of time, there has been considerable advancement in the scientific understanding of heatwaves. Such advancements include how heatwaves are measured, their driving mechanisms, observed and projected changes, and quantifying the anthropogenic influence behind these changes. This paper reviews these developments. There are however gaps in the scientific literature that should be filled in order to gain a more complete understanding of the changing nature of heatwaves. The conclusions of this paper propose that the global community should work toward a unified framework in which to measure heatwaves, reduce spatial and temporal gaps by increasing the global observation network, further research on how physical mechanisms interact for heatwave manifestation, and continual work and expansion of methods used for attribution studies on observed heatwaves and their trends.},

Analyses focused on heat-related deaths, as designated by the medical examiner, and on the number of excess deaths. Results. In July 1995, there were 514 heat-related deaths and 696 excess deaths. People 65 years of age or older were overrepresented and Hispanic people underrepresented. During the most intense heat (July 14 through 20), there were 485 heat-related deaths and 739 excess deaths. Conclusions. The methods used here provide insight into the great impact of the Chicago heat wave on selected populations, but the lack of methodological standards makes comparisons across geographical areas problematic.},

   abstract = {Background: Climate models project that heat waves will increase in frequency and severity. Despite many studies of mortality from heat waves, few studies have examined morbidity. Objectives: In this study we investigated whether any age or race/ ethnicity groups experienced increased hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits overall or for selected illnesses during the 2006 California heat wave. Methods: We aggregated county-level hospitalizations and ED visits for all causes and for 10 cause groups into six geographic regions of California. We calculated excess morbidity and rate ratios (RRs) during the heat wave (15 July to 1 August 2006) and compared these data with those of a reference period (8-14 July and 12-22 August 2006). Results: During the heat wave, 16,166 excess ED visits and 1,182 excess hospitalizations occurred statewide. ED visits for heat-related causes increased across the state [RR = 6.30; 95% confidence interval (CI), 5.67-7.01], especially in the Central Coast region, which includes San Francisco. Children (0-4 years of age) and the elderly (≥ 65 years of age) were at greatest risk. ED visits also showed significant increases for acute renal failure, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, electrolyte imbalance, and nephritis. We observed significantly elevated RRs for hospitalizations for heat-related illnesses (RR = 10.15; 95% CI, 7.79-13.43), acute renal failure, electrolyte imbalance, and nephritis. Conclusions: The 2006 California heat wave had a substantial effect on morbidity, including regions with relatively modest temperatures. This suggests that population acclimatization and adaptive capacity influenced risk. By better understanding these impacts and population vulnerabilities, local communities can improve heat wave preparedness to cope with a globally warming future.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mortality during sustained periods of hot weather is generally regarded as being in excess of what would be predicted from smooth temperature-mortality gradients estimated using standard time-series regression models. However, the evidence for an effect of continuous days of exceptional heat ("heat wave effect") is indirect. In addition, because some interventions may be triggered only during forecasted heat waves, it would be helpful to know what fraction of all heat-related deaths falls during these specific periods and what fraction occurs throughout the remainder of the summer. METHODS: Extended time-series data sets of daily mortality counts in 3 major European cities (London, 28 years of data; Budapest, 31 years; Milan, 18 years) were examined in relation to hot weather using a generalized estimating equations approach. We modeled temperature and specific heat wave terms using a variety of specifications. RESULTS: With a linear effect of same-day temperature above an identified threshold, an additional "heat wave" effect of 5.5% was observed in London (95% confidence interval = 2.2 to 8.9), 9.3% in Budapest (5.8 to 13.0), and 15.2% in Milan (5.7 to 22.5). Heat wave effects were reduced slightly when we relaxed the linear assumption and these effects were reduced substantially when temperature was modeled as an average value of lags 0 to 2 days. In London, fewer than half of all heat-related deaths could be attributed to identified heat wave periods. In Milan and Budapest, the fraction was less than one fifth. CONCLUSIONS: Heat wave effects were apparent in simple time-series models but were reduced in multilag nonlinear models and small when compared with the overall summertime mortality burden of heat. Reduction of the overall heat burden requires preventive measures in addition to those that target warnings and responses uniquely to heat waves. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.},

   abstract = {Background: The present study aimed at developing a standardized heat wave definition to estimate and compare the impact on mortality by gender, age and death causes in Europe during summers 1990-2004 and 2003, separately, accounting for heat wave duration and intensity. Methods: Heat waves were defined considering both maximum apparent temperature and minimum temperature and classified by intensity, duration and timing during summer. The effect was estimated as percent increase in daily mortality during heat wave days compared to non heat wave days in people over 65 years. City specific and pooled estimates by gender, age and cause of death were calculated. Results: The effect of heat waves showed great geographical heterogeneity among cities. Considering all years, except 2003, the increase in mortality during heat wave days ranged from + 7.6% in Munich to + 33.6% in Milan. The increase was up to 3-times greater during episodes of long duration and high intensity. Pooled results showed a greater impact in Mediterranean (+ 21.8% for total mortality) than in North Continental (+ 12.4%) cities. The highest effect was observed for respiratory diseases and among women aged 75-84 years. In 2003 the highest impact was observed in cities where heat wave episode was characterized by unusual meteorological conditions. Conclusions: Climate change scenarios indicate that extreme events are expected to increase in the future even in regions where heat waves are not frequent. Considering our results prevention programs should specifically target the elderly, women and those suffering from chronic respiratory disorders, thus reducing the impact on mortality. © 2010 D'Ippoliti et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {Background: Devastating health effects from recent heat waves, and projected increases in frequency, duration, and severity of heat waves from climate change, highlight the importance of understanding health consequences of heat waves. Objectives: We analyzed mortality risk for heat waves in 43 U.S. cities (1987-2005) and investigated how effects relate to heat waves' intensity, duration, or timing in season. Methods: Heat waves were defined as ≥ 2 days with temperature ≥ 95th percentile for the community for 1 May through 30 September. Heat waves were characterized by their intensity, duration, and timing in season. Within each community, we estimated mortality risk during each heat wave compared with non-heat wave days, controlling for potential confounders. We combined individual heat wave effect estimates using Bayesian hierarchical modeling to generate overall effects at the community, regional, and national levels. We estimated how heat wave mortality effects were modified by heat wave characteristics (intensity, duration, timing in season). Results: Nationally, mortality increased 3.74% [95% posterior interval (PI), 2.29-5.22%] during heat waves compared with non-heat wave days. Heat wave mortality risk increased 2.49% for every 1°F increase in heat wave intensity and 0.38% for every 1-day increase in heat wave duration. Mortality increased 5.04% (95% PI, 3.06-7.06%) during the first heat wave of the summer versus 2.65% (95% PI, 1.14-4.18%) during later heat waves, compared with non-heat wave days. Heat wave mortality impacts and effect modification by heat wave characteristics were more pronounced in the Northeast and Midwest compared with the South. Conclusions: We found higher mortality risk from heat waves that were more intense or longer, or those occurring earlier in summer. These findings have implications for decision makers and researchers estimating health effects from climate change.},

   abstract = {Background: Heat waves have been linked with an increase in mortality, but the associated risk has been only partly characterized. Methods: We examined this association by decomposing the risk for temperature into a "main effect" due to independent effects of daily high temperatures, and an "added" effect due to sustained duration of heat during waves, using data from 108 communities in the United States during 1987-2000. We adopted different definitions of heat-wave days on the basis of combinations of temperature thresholds and days of duration. The main effect was estimated through distributed lag nonlinear functions of temperature, which account for nonlinear delayed effects and short-time harvesting. We defined the main effect as the relative risk between the median city-specific temperature during heat-wave days and the 75th percentile of the year-round distribution. The added effect was defined first using a simple indicator, and then a function of consecutive heat-wave days. City-specific main and added effects were pooled through univariate and multivariate meta-analytic techniques. Results: The added wave effect was small (0.2%-2.8% excess relative risk, depending on wave definition) compared with the main effect (4.9%-8.0%), and was apparent only after 4 consecutive heat-wave days. Conclusions: Most of the excess risk with heat waves in the United States can be simply summarized as the independent effects of individual days' temperatures. A smaller added effect arises in heat waves lasting more than 4 days. © 2010 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

   abstract = {High temperatures and heat waves are related but not synonymous concepts. Heat waves, generally understood to be acute periods of extreme warmth, are relevant to a wide range of stakeholders because of the impacts that these events have on human health and activities and on natural environments. Perhaps because of the diversity of communities engaged in heat wave monitoring and research, there is no single, standard definition of a heat wave. Experts differ in which threshold values (absolute versus relative), duration and ancillary variables to incorporate into heat wave definitions. While there is value in this diversity of perspectives, the lack of a unified index can cause confusion when discussing patterns, trends, and impacts. Here, we use data from the North American Land Data Assimilation System to examine patterns and trends in 15 previously published heat wave indices for the period 1979-2011 across the Continental United States. Over this period the Southeast region saw the highest number of heat wave days for the majority of indices considered. Positive trends (increases in number of heat wave days per year) were greatest in the Southeast and Great Plains regions, where more than 12 % of the land area experienced significant increases in the number of heat wave days per year for the majority of heat wave indices. Significant negative trends were relatively rare, but were found in portions of the Southwest, Northwest, and Great Plains. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

   abstract = {In the past few decades, several devastating heat wave events have significantly challenged public health. As these events are projected to increase in both severity and frequency in the future, it is important to assess the relationship between heat waves and the health indicators that can be used in the early warning systems to guide the public health response. Yet there is a knowledge gap in the impact of heat waves on morbidity. In this study, a comprehensive review was conducted to assess the relationship between heat waves and different morbidity indicators, and to identify the vulnerable populations. The PubMed and ScienceDirect database were used to retrieve published literature in English from 1985 to 2014 on the relationship between heat waves and morbidity, and the following MeSH terms and keywords were used: heat wave, heat wave, morbidity, hospital admission, hospitalization, emergency call, emergency medical services, and outpatient visit. Thirty-three studies were included in the final analysis. Most studies found a short-term negative health impact of heat waves on morbidity. The elderly, children, and males were more vulnerable during heat waves, and the medical care demand increased for those with existing chronic diseases. Some social factors, such as lower socioeconomic status, can contribute to heat-susceptibility. In terms of study methods and heat wave definitions, there remain inconsistencies and uncertainties. Relevant policies and guidelines need to be developed to protect vulnerable populations. Morbidity indicators should be adopted in heat wave early warning systems in order to guide the effective implementation of public health actions.},

   abstract = {Background: Few studies have examined variation in the associations between heat waves and mortality in an international context. Objectives: We aimed to systematically examine the impacts of heat waves on mortality with lag effects internationally. Methods: We collected daily data of temperature and mortality from 400 communities in 18 countries/regions and defined 12 types of heat waves by combining community-specific daily mean temperature ≥ 90th, 92.5th, 95th, and 97.5th percentiles of temperature with duration ≥ 2, 3, and 4 d. We used time-series analyses to estimate the community-specific heat wave-mortality relation over lags of 0-10 d. Then, we applied meta-analysis to pool heat wave effects at the country level for cumulative and lag effects for each type of heat wave definition. Results: Heat waves of all definitions had significant cumulative associations with mortality in all countries, but varied by community. The higher the temperature threshold used to define heat waves, the higher heat wave associations on mortality. However, heat wave duration did not modify the impacts. The association between heat waves and mortality appeared acutely and lasted for 3 and 4 d. Heat waves had higher associations with mortality in moderate cold and moderate hot areas than cold and hot areas. There were no added effects of heat waves on mortality in all countries/regions, except for Brazil, Moldova, and Taiwan. Heat waves defined by daily mean and maximum temperatures produced similar heat wave-mortality associations, but not daily minimum temperature. Conclusions: Results indicate that high temperatures create a substantial health burden, and effects of high temperatures over consecutive days are similar to what would be experienced if high temperature days occurred independently. People living in moderate cold and moderate hot areas are more sensitive to heat waves than those living in cold and hot areas. Daily mean and maximum temperatures had similar ability to define heat waves rather than minimum temperature.},

   abstract = {One of the direct and unavoidable consequences of global warming-induced rising temperatures is the more recurrent and severe heatwaves. In recent years, even countries like Malaysia seldom had some mild to severe heatwaves. As the Earth's average temperature continues to rise, heatwaves in Malaysia will undoubtedly worsen in the future. It is crucial to characterize and monitor heat events across time to effectively prepare for and implement preventative actions to lessen heatwave's social and economic effects. This study proposes heatwave-related indices that take into account both daily maximum (Tmax) and daily lowest (Tmin) temperatures to evaluate shifts in heatwave features in Peninsular Malaysia (PM). Daily ERA5 temperature dataset with a geographical resolution of 0.25° for the period 1950–2022 was used to analyze the changes in the frequency and severity of heat waves across PM, while the LandScan gridded population data from 2000 to 2020 was used to calculate the affected population to the heatwaves. This study also utilized Sen's slope for trend analysis of heatwave characteristics, which separates multi-decadal oscillatory fluctuations from secular trends. The findings demonstrated that the geographical pattern of heatwaves in PM could be reconstructed if daily Tmax is more than the 95th percentile for 3 or more days. The data indicated that the southwest was more prone to severe heatwaves. The PM experienced more heatwaves after 2000 than before. Overall, the heatwave-affected area in PM has increased by 8.98&nbsp;km2/decade and its duration by 1.54&nbsp;days/decade. The highest population affected was located in the central south region of PM. These findings provide valuable insights into the heatwaves pattern and impact.},

Despite the considerable risks posed to public health, there is a lack of comprehensive research, evaluating the spatiotemporal changes in human thermal discomfort and its characteristics in hot-hyper arid regions, such as the Arabian Peninsula (AP). The current study analyzes spatiotemporal changes in human thermal discomfort categories and their characteristics in AP, using the newly developed high-resolution gridded ERA5-HEAT (Human thErmAl comforT) dataset for the period 1979–2022. In addition, the study assesses the interplay between the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indices for the study period. The results reveal a significant increase in human thermal discomfort and its characteristics, with higher spatial variability in the AP region. The major urban centers in the southwestern, central, and southeastern parts of AP have experienced significant increases in human thermal discomfort (0.4–0.8&nbsp;°C), with higher frequency and intensity of thermal stress during the study period. The temporal distribution demonstrates a linear increase in UTCI indices and their frequencies and intensities, particularly from 1998 onward, signifying a transition towards a hotter climate characterized by frequent, intense, and prolonged heat stress conditions. Moreover, the UTCI and ENSO indices exhibit a dipole pattern of correlation with a positive (negative) pattern in the southwestern (eastern parts) of AP. The study’s findings suggest that policymakers and urban planners need to prioritize public health and well-being in AP’s urban areas, especially for vulnerable groups, by implementing climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, and carefully designing future cities to mitigate the effects of heat stress.},

The extreme heat vulnerability index (EHVI) was evaluated in this study to identify the most vulnerable districts to extreme heat events. We used both physical and sociodemographic to assess exposure, population sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. A multivariate analysis was applied from eight indicators to determine the extreme heat vulnerability in the chosen region, namely North Sumatra, East Java and Bali. The EHVI was computed by adding the normalized heat indicators and factor scores from the multivariate analysis. Our findings show that the most vulnerable populations are concentrated in the urban and coastal regions. The sources of vulnerability differed among the selected areas, with urbanization and population density increasing vulnerability in urban areas. These findings are helpful in identifying districts vulnerable to extreme heat and assisting regulatory bodies in developing effective adaptation and preparedness strategies to increase population resilience to excessive heat.},

   abstract = {Heat-health risk is a growing concern in many regions of China due to the more frequent occurrence of extremely hot weather. Spatial indexes based on various heat assessment frameworks can be used for the assessment of heat risks. In this study, we adopted two approaches—Crichton’s risk triangle and heat vulnerability index (HVI) to identify heat-health risks in the Northern Jiangxi Province of China, by using remote sensing and socio-economic data. The Geographical Information System (GIS) overlay and principal component analysis (PCA) were separately used in two frameworks to integrate parameters. The results show that the most densely populated community in the suburbs, instead of city centers, are exposed to the highest heat risk. A comparison of two heat assessment mapping indicates that the distribution of HVI highlights the vulnerability differences between census tracts. In contrast, the heat risk index of Crichton’s risk triangle has a prominent representation for regions with high risks. The stepwise multiple linear regression zero-order correlation coefficient between HVI and outdoor workers is 0.715, highlighting the vulnerability of this particular group. Spearman’s rho nonparametric correlation and the mean test reveals that heat risk index is strongly correlated with HVI in most of the main urban regions in the study area, with a significantly lower value than the latter. The analysis of variance shows that the distribution of HVI exhibits greater variety across urban regions than that of heat risk index. Our research provides new insight into heat risk assessment for further study of heat health risk in developing countries.},

Analysis of societal vulnerability to extreme heat events requires an interdisciplinary approach that includes information about weather and climate, the natural and built environment, social processes and characteristics, interactions with stakeholders, and an assessment of community vulnerability at a local level. In this letter, we explore the relationships between people and places, in the context of urban heat stress, and present a new research framework for a multi-faceted, top-down and bottom-up analysis of local-level vulnerability to extreme heat. This framework aims to better represent societal vulnerability through the integration of quantitative and qualitative data that go beyond aggregate demographic information. We discuss how different elements of the framework help to focus attention and resources on more targeted health interventions, heat hazard mitigation and climate adaptation strategies. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Although Pakistan stands at 12th rank among highly exposed countries to climate change, very little research has been dedicated in exploring the heat-related vulnerability of exposed populations. We have applied the principal component analysis with varimax rotation on well-established indicators of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity to determine the heat vulnerability. This study has resulted in two principal components sharing 70.4% variance. Principal component 1 comprises pre-existing illness, population density, housing density, education, and normalized difference vegetation index with following significant (> 0.4) loading values 0.91, 0.91, 0.91, 0.57, and − 0.773, respectively, and principal component 2 combines the nature of housing material (0.964) followed by the water availability (0.962) and minority status (0.539). The hot spot analysis and overlay analysis have also been applied on the extracted component, and the resultant co-occurrence of high variable class, high vulnerability, and hot spots of vulnerability helped to grip those areas which imperatively require the applications of heat-related health interventions. The heat vulnerability index developed in our study clarifies that the most vulnerable populations are confined in the central vicinities of Lahore and less vulnerable are those which inhibit towards the outskirts of the city.},

   abstract = {Background: Tibet is especially vulnerable to climate change due to the relatively rapid rise of temperature over past decades. The effects on mortality and morbidity of extreme heat in Tibet have been examined in previous studies; no heat adaptation initiatives have yet been implemented. We estimated heat vulnerability of urban and rural populations in 73 Tibetan counties and identified potential areas for public health intervention and further research. Methods: According to data availability and vulnerability factors identified previously in Tibet and elsewhere, we selected 10 variables related to advanced age, low income, illiteracy, physical and mental disability, small living spaces and living alone. We separately created and mapped county-level cumulative heat vulnerability indices for urban and rural residents by summing up factor scores produced by a principal components analysis (PCA). Results: For both study populations, PCA yielded four factors with similar structure. The components for rural and urban residents explained 76.5 % and 77.7 % respectively of the variability in the original vulnerability variables. We found spatial variability of heat vulnerability across counties, with generally higher vulnerability in high-altitude counties. Although we observed similar median values and ranges of the cumulative heat vulnerability index values among urban and rural residents overall, the pattern varied strongly from one county to another. Conclusions: We have developed a measure of population vulnerability to high temperatures in Tibet. These are preliminary findings, but they may assist targeted adaptation plans in response to future rapid warming in Tibet.},

The cities at high or very high risk are found in Metro Manila, where levels of heat hazard and exposure are high. The most vulnerable cities are, however, found mainly outside the national capital region, where sensitivity is higher and capacity to cope and adapt is lower. Cities with high levels of heat vulnerability and exposure must be prioritized for adaptation.

Geocoded addresses were mapped to correlate patient prevalence with heat vulnerability of census tracts. Census tracts closer to the city center had elevated vulnerability scores. Patient prevalence was positively correlated with HVI score (Pearson’s r(44) = 0.67, p < 0.01). Statistical significance persists after correction for spatial autocorrelation (modified t-test p < 0.01). The study indicates that individuals treated at this community mental health center are more likely to live in census tracts with high heat vulnerability.

Several studies over the years, both within and outside of India, have shown how extreme heat events lead to an overall increase in mortality. However, the impact of extreme heat, similar to other disasters, depends upon the vulnerability of the population. This study aims to assess the extreme heat vulnerability of the population of four cities with different characteristics across India. This cross-sectional study included 500 households from each city across the urban localities (both slum and non-slum) of Ongole in Andhra Pradesh, Karimnagar in Telangana, Kolkata in West Bengal and Angul in Odisha. Twenty-one indicators were used to construct a household vulnerability index to understand the vulnerability of the cities. The results have shown that the majority of the households fell under moderate to high vulnerability level across all the cities. Angul and Kolkata were found to be more highly vulnerable as compared to Ongole and Karimnagar. Further analysis also revealed that household vulnerability is more significantly related to adaptive capacity than sensitivity and exposure. Heat Vulnerability Index can help in identifying the vulnerable population and scaling up adaptive practices.},

Emphasis is currently being placed on the development of spatially specific vulnerability models, which are useful for decision support during extreme heat events (EHE). Research results concerning such spatially-explicit models lead efforts in preparation and mitigation of heat-related vulnerability and potential adaptation. The presented research analyzes the 1995 Chicago EHE in the context of a socio-environmental hazards approach, and fosters the development of an extreme heat vulnerability index (EHVI). The EHVI is a fused dataset consisting of census data and remotely sensed variables, which are examined in relation to geocoded mortality data. The presented analysis combines 25 well-known indicators of extreme heat-health risk into an applied index utilizing a principal components analysis. The developed EHVI presented a trend of higher rates of death in the highest risk zones to lower rates in lower zones of risk. The model explains nearly 80% of the total variance in the heat-health vulnerability variables utilized. This index could be utilized by city officials to assist in the mitigation of extreme heat events and is a further evolution of previously developed efforts. Our findings indicate extreme heat vulnerability models should likely be developed on a local level for a specific location, taking into account local variations in social and environmental vulnerability. © 2012.},

Partnerships between city policymakers and scientists are becoming more important as the need to provide data-driven recommendations for sustainability and mitigation efforts becomes critical. Here we present a model to produce heat vulnerability index (HVI) maps driven by surface temperature data from National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) new Ecosystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) thermal infrared sensor. ECOSTRESS was launched in June 2018 with the capability to image fine-scale urban temperatures at a 70 m resolution throughout different times of the day and night. The HVI model further includes information on socio-demographic data, green vegetation abundance, and historical heatwave temperatures from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard the Aqua spacecraft since 2002. During a period of high heat in July 2018, we identified the five most vulnerable communities at a sub-city block scale in the LA region. The persistence of high HVI throughout the day and night in these areas indicates a clear and urgent need for implementing cooling technologies and green infrastructure to curb future warming.},

The output maps identified the hot zones through comprehensive GIS analysis. The resultant maps showed that high HVI exists in three typical areas: (1) areas with dense population and low vegetation, (2) areas with artificial surfaces (built-up areas), and (3) industrial zones. Low-HVI areas are in natural landscapes such as rivers and grasslands. Our analysis can be implemented in other cities to highlight areas at high risk of extreme heat and air pollution.},

To mitigate heat exposure and protect sensitive populations, urban planners are increasingly using heat vulnerability indices (HVIs) to identify high priority areas for intervention and investment. Relative HVI scores help identify which areas are at greatest risk of heat-related morbidity and mortality. Public health researchers are also increasingly using observation-driven exposure-response functions to estimate heat-related mortality. In this paper, we estimate the number and spatial distribution of heat-related deaths in Dallas in 2011 employing an exposure-response function and then assess the performance of different HVI techniques in assigning vulnerability to zones of high heat mortality. Our approach estimates that 112 Dallas residents died from heat-related causes in the summer of 2011 and finds wide variability in the performance of different HVI techniques in assessing heat vulnerability by district. The HVI is found to retain more useful information mapped as separate components of vulnerability than as a single composite score. While the exposure-response function is preferred, the methods can be used in conjunction to assess appropriate heat management strategies.},

   abstract = {Increased frequency and length of high heat episodes are leading to more cardiovascular issues and asthmatic responses among the population of San Juan, the capital of the island of Puerto Rico, USA. An urban heat island effect, which leads to foci of higher temperatures in some urban areas, can raise heat-related mortality. The objective of this research is to map the risk of high temperature in particular locations by creating heat maps of the city of San Juan. The heat vulnerability index (HVI) maps were developed using images collected by satellite-based remote sensing combined with census data. Land surface temperature was assessed using images from the Thermal Infrared Sensor flown on Landsat 8. Social determinants (e.g., age, unemployment, education and social isolation, and health insurance coverage) were analyzed by census tract. The data were examined in the context of land cover maps generated using products from the Puerto Rico Terrestrial Gap Analysis Project (USDA Forest Service). All variables were set in order to transform the indicators expressed in different units into indices between 0 and 1, and the HVI was calculated as sum of score. The tract with highest index was considered to be the most vulnerable and the lowest to be the least vulnerable. Five vulnerability classes were mapped (very high, high, moderate, low, and very low). The hottest and the most vulnerable tracts corresponded to highly built areas, including the Luis Munoz International Airport, seaports, parking lots, and high-density residential areas. Several variables contributed to increased vulnerability, including higher rates of the population living alone, disabilities, advanced age, and lack of health insurance coverage. Coolest areas corresponded to vegetated landscapes and urban water bodies. The urban HVI map will be useful to health officers, emergency preparedness personnel, the National Weather Service, and San Juan residents, as it helps to prepare for and to mitigate the potential effects of heat-related illnesses.},

   abstract = {Context: Extreme heat waves elevate the population's risk for heat-related morbidity and mortality, specifically for vulnerable groups such as older adults and young children. In this context, we developed 2 Heat Vulnerability Indices (HVIs), one for the state of Wisconsin and one for the Milwaukee metropolitan area. Objective: Through the creation of an HVI, state and local agencies will be able to use the indices as a planning tool for extreme heat events. Design: Data used for the HVIs were grouped into 4 categories: (1) population density; (2) health factors; (3) demographic and socioeconomic factors; and (4) natural and built environment factors. These categories were mapped at the Census block group level. Main Outcome Measures: Unweighted z-score data were used to determine index scores, which were then mapped by quantiles ranging from "high" to "low" vulnerability. Results: Statewide, Menominee County exhibited the highest vulnerability to extreme heat. Milwaukee HVI findings indicated high vulnerability in the city's inner core versus low vulnerability along the lakeshore. Conclusion: Visualization of vulnerability could help local public health agencies prepare for future extreme heat events.},

   abstract = {Assessing geographic variability in heat wave vulnerability forms the basis for planning appropriate targeted adaptation strategies. Given several recent deadly heatwaves in India, heat is increasingly being recognized as a public health problem. However, to date there has not been a country-wide assessment of heat vulnerability in India. We evaluated demographic, socioeconomic, and environmental vulnerability factors and combined district level data from several sources including the most recent census, health reports, and satellite remote sensing data. We then applied principal component analysis (PCA) on 17 normalized variables for each of the 640 districts to create a composite Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) for India. Of the total 640 districts, our analysis identified 10 and 97 districts in the very high and high risk categories (> 2SD and 2-1SD HVI) respectively. Mapping showed that the districts with higher heat vulnerability are located in the central parts of the country. On examination, these are less urbanized and have low rates of literacy, access to water and sanitation, and presence of household amenities. Therefore, we concluded that creating and mapping a heat vulnerability index is a useful first step in protecting the public from the health burden of heat. Future work should incorporate heat exposure and health outcome data to validate the index, as well as examine sub-district levels of vulnerability.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this work was to assess population vulnerability to heat-related health risks and its relationship with urbanization levels to provide essential information for the future development and policy-making for climate change adaptation. We constructed a heat vulnerability index (HVI), quantified the population heat vulnerability in each county across China by a principal component analysis (PCA) of multiple factors, and assessed urbanization levels in each county using multisource data. Then, the HVI was validated using the heat-attributable fraction (heat-AF) of nonaccidental mortality based on death monitoring data and meteorological data from 95 counties across China. The results showed that our HVI was significantly positively associated with the heat AF of nonaccidental mortality. A negative correlation was observed between the urbanization level and the HVI. The HVI was generally higher in less urbanized western China and lower in the more urbanized eastern regions. The baseline mortality occupies the top position in the importance ranking of the heat-vulnerability indicators at all three urbanization levels, but the other indicators, including the aging rate, agricultural population rate, education, ethnic structure, economic status, air conditioner ownership rate, and number of hospitals, ranked differently among different urbanization levels. This finding indicates that to reduce population heat vulnerability, the most important approach is to improve the health status of the whole population and reduce baseline mortality; additionally, regional-specific measures and emphasis should be adjusted reasonably along with the process of urbanization according to the characteristics and key factors of local heat vulnerability.},

Risk factors include housing characteristics, and socioeconomic factors, or environmental risk factors such as urban heat islands. This study developed an index of population vulnerability in an urban setting using known environmental, demographic, and health-related risk factors for heat stress. The spatial variations in risk factors were correlated with spatial variation in heat-related health outcomes in urban Melbourne. The index was weighted using measured health outcomes during heatwave periods. The index was then mapped to produce a spatial representation of risk. The key risk factors were identified as areas with aged care facilities, higher proportions of older people living alone, living in suburban rather than inner city areas, and areas with larger proportions of people who spoke a language other than English at home. The maps of spatial vulnerability provide information to target heat-related health risks by aiding policy advisors, urban planners, healthcare professionals, and ancillary services to develop heatwave preparedness plans at a local scale.},

   abstract = {Due to the inevitable increase in temperatures that are attributable to significant climate variability and notable shifts in climate under increasing greenhouse gases, heat waves are becoming a major natural disaster. They lead to elevating incidences of human mortality, health risks, and damage to the economy, agriculture, and natural ecosystems. As a precautionary foresight to mitigate detrimental impacts of this disaster, a better understanding of regional vulnerability to heat waves is essential. This study has investigated the cumulative role of the social and climatic factors on heatwave-related deaths across the 232 administrative counties in Korea. Correlation and clustering analyses performed on heatwave-related deaths and social and climatic factors indicated that the number of heatwave days, tropical nights, elderly living alone, and agricultural workers had a significant relationship with the number of heatwave-related deaths. In order to demonstrate the practicality of this approach for heatwave analysis, a spatial heatwave vulnerability map was created to identify the distribution of heatwave risk by compositing the four most significant vulnerability factors identified with regression method. Among the several available regression methods that are applied on countable data, this study has utilized zero-inflated Poisson regression because the available data on heatwave-related deaths included many zeros. The heatwave vulnerability map depicted well the actual distribution of heatwave-related deaths, particularly for counties with a large number of heatwave deaths. In light of this evidence, it is postulated that the heatwave vulnerability map can be used as a useful decision-making tool that can help facilitate efficient utilization of various disaster management resources at the national level and also to identify emphatically the heatwave-related risk over spatial scales to aid in the establishment of customized health risk precautionary measures.},

   abstract = {Extreme heat is the leading cause of heat-related mortality around the world. Extracting heat vulnerability information from the urban complexity system is crucial for urban health studies. Using heat vulnerability index (HVI) is the most common approach for urban planners to locate the places with high vulnerability for intervention and protection. Previous studies have demonstrated that HVI can play a vital role in determining which areas are at risk of heat-related deaths. Both equal weight approach (EWA) and principal component analysis (PCA) are the conventional methods to aggregate indicators to HVI. However, seldom studies have compared the differences between these two approaches in estimating HVI. In this paper, we evaluated the HVIs in Hangzhou in 2013, employing EWA and PCA, and assessed the accuracies of these two HVIs by using heat-related deaths. Our results show that both HVI maps showed that areas with high vulnerability are located in the central area while those with low vulnerability are located in the suburban area. The comparison between HVIEWA and HVIPCA shows significantly different spatial distributions, which is caused by the various weight factors in EWA and PCA. The relationship between HVIEWA and heat-related deaths performs better than the relationship between HVIPCA and deaths, implying EWA could be a better method to evaluate heat vulnerability than PCA. The HVIEWA can provide a spatial distribution of heat vulnerability at intracity to direct heat adaptation and emergency capacity planning.},

Despite expected increased frequency and intensity of heat waves, the health impacts of such events in urban areas can be minimized with careful policy and economic investments. We focus on Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and ask two questions. First, what are the top factors contributing to heat vulnerability and how do these characteristics manifest geospatially throughout Pittsburgh? Second, assuming the City wishes to deploy additional cooling centers, what placement will optimally address the vulnerability of the at risk populations? We use national census data, ArcGIS geospatial modeling, and statistical analysis to determine a range of heat vulnerability indices and optimal cooling center placement. We find that while different studies use different data and statistical calculations, all methods tested locate additional cooling centers at the confluence of the three rivers (Downtown), the northeast side of Pittsburgh (Shadyside/Highland Park), and the southeast side of Pittsburgh (Squirrel Hill). This suggests that for Pittsburgh, a researcher could apply the same factor analysis procedure to compare data sets for different locations and times; factor analyses for heat vulnerability are more robust than previously thought.},

This review includes 15 studies concerning heat vulnerability assessment.

We concluded that the HVI is useful for targeting the intervention of heat risk, and that heat-related health outcomes could be used to validate and optimize the HVI. In the future, more studies should be conducted to provide references for the selection of heat-related indicators and the determination of weight values of these indicators in the development of the HVI.

This is especially so for large cities where there is a concentration of people and because of the urban heat island effect. Temperatures within cities can reach stressful levels during extreme temperature events. To better manage heat related health risks, information is required on the intra-urban variability of vulnerability to heat wave events. Accordingly a heat vulnerability index (HVI) is developed and presented for Greater London in the United Kingdom. The approach to HVI development adopted is an inductive one whereby nine proxy measures of heat risk are extracted from the 2001 London census for 4765 census districts and subject to principal components analysis. Scores for the emergent principal components are weighted according to the variance they explain and summed to form the HVI. Although mapping of the HVI shows what appears to be a heterogeneous heat "risk-scape" statistical testing reveals significant spatial clustering of areas of high heat vulnerability in central and east London which also co-occur with areas of potentially high heat exposure. Drivers of the spatial pattern of heat vulnerability are discussed as are the implications of study results for heat risk management in large cities. © 2013 The Authors.},

   abstract = {Objectives: The frequency and intensity of extreme heat events are increasing in New York State (NYS) and have been linked with increased heat-related morbidity and mortality. But these effects are not uniform across the state and can vary across large regions due to regional sociodemographic and environmental factors which impact an individual's response or adaptive capacity to heat and in turn contribute to vulnerability among certain populations. We developed a heat vulnerability index (HVI) to identify heat-vulnerable populations and regions in NYS. Study design: Census tract level environmental and sociodemographic heat-vulnerability variables were used to develop the HVI to identify heat-vulnerable populations and areas. Methods: Variables were identified from a comprehensive literature review and climate-health research in NYS. We obtained data from 2010 US Census Bureau and 2011 National Land Cover Database. We used principal component analysis to reduce correlated variables to fewer uncorrelated components, and then calculated the cumulative HVI for each census tract by summing up the scores across the components. The HVI was then mapped across NYS (excluding New York City) to display spatial vulnerability. The prevalence rates of heat stress were compared across HVI score categories. Results: Thirteen variables were reduced to four meaningful components representing 1) social/language vulnerability; 2) socioeconomic vulnerability; 3) environmental/urban vulnerability; and 4) elderly/ social isolation. Vulnerability to heat varied spatially in NYS with the HVI showing that metropolitan areas were most vulnerable, with language barriers and socioeconomic disadvantage contributing to the most vulnerability. Reliability of the HVI was supported by preliminary results where higher rates of heat stress were collocated in the regions with the highest HVI. Conclusions: The NYS HVI showed spatial variability in heat vulnerability across the state. Mapping the HVI allows quick identification of regions in NYS that could benefit from targeted interventions. The HVI will be used as a planning tool to help allocate appropriate adaptation measures like cooling centers and issue heat alerts to mitigate effects of heat in vulnerable areas.},

   abstract = {Purpose of review: This review aims to identify the key factors, methods, and spatial units used in the development and validation of the heat vulnerability index (HVI) and discuss the underlying limitations of the data and methods by evaluating the performance of the HVI. Recent findings: Thirteen studies characterizing the factors of the HVI development and relating the index with validation data were identified. Five types of factors (i.e., hazard exposure, demographic characteristics, socioeconomic conditions, built environment, and underlying health) of the HVI development were identified, and the top five were social cohesion, race, and/or ethnicity, landscape, age, and economic status. The principal component analysis/factor analysis (PCA/FA) was often used in index development, and four types of spatial units (i.e., census tracts, administrative area, postal code, grid) were used for establishing the relationship between factors and the HVI. Moreover, although most studies showed that a higher HVI was often associated with the increase in health risk, the strength of the relationship was weak. Summary: This review provides a retrospect of the major factors, methods, and spatial units used in development and validation of the HVI and helps to define the framework for future studies. In the future, more information on the hazard exposure, underlying health, governance, and protection awareness should be considered in the HVI development, and the duration and location of validation data should be strengthened to verify the reliability of HVI.},

Finally, we attempt to map the spatial distribution of high heat-wave-related mortality risk based on the results of heat wave vulnerability study and artificial society. The results reveal that 1) there are differences in the influence of urbanisation on heat wave exposure, sensitivity and adaptability; 2) the exposure and sensitivity level effects on the lower limit of health impacts and the adaptability level effects on the upper limit of the health impact from heat wave in a given study area; and 3) areas vulnerable to the effects of heat waves are not confined to the city centre, which implies that residents living in suburban areas are also vulnerable to heat waves. Finally, this study not only explores the factors contributing to the impacts of heat waves but also describes the spatial distribution of the risk of disaster-associated mortality, thereby providing direct scientific guidance that can be used by cities to address heat wave disasters in the future.},

We also identified potential local risk factors not included in the generic indicators. Methods: To evaluate the accuracy of the generic index in a city-specific context, we used factor scores, derived from a factor analysis using census tract–level characteristics, as independent variables, and heat hospitalizations (with census tracts categorized as zero-, moderate-, or highincidence) as dependent variables in a multinomial logistic regression model. We also compared the geographical differences between a vulnerability map derived from the generic index and one derived from actual heat-related hospitalizations at the census-tract scale. results: We found that the national-indicator framework correctly classified just over half (54%) of census tracts in Phoenix. Compared with all census tracts, high-vulnerability tracts that were misclassified by the index as zero-vulnerability tracts had higher average income and higher proportions of residents with a duration of residency < 5 years. conclusion: The generic indicators of vulnerability are useful, but they are sensitive to scale, measurement, and context. Decision makers need to consider the characteristics of their cities to determine how closely vulnerability maps based on generic indicators reflect actual risk of harm.},

It is found that the Russian heat wave was associated with the development of an extraordinarily strong and prolonged extratropical atmospheric blocking event in association with the excitation of a large-scale atmospheric Rossby wave train spanning western Russia, Kazakhstan, and the northwestern China-Tibetan Plateau region. The southward penetration of upper-level vorticity perturbations in the leading trough of the Rossby wave was instrumental in triggering anomalously heavy rain events over northern Pakistan and vicinity in mid- to late July. Also shown are evidences that the Russian heat wave was amplified by a positive feedback through changes in surface energy fluxes between the atmospheric blocking pattern and an underlying extensive land region with below-normal soil moisture. The Pakistan heavy rain events were amplified and sustained by strong anomalous southeasterly flow along the Himalayan foothills and abundant moisture transport from the Bay of Bengal in connection with the northward propagation of the monsoonal intraseasonal oscillation. © 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

Emphasis is currently being placed on the development of spatially specific vulnerability models, which are useful for decision support during extreme heat events (EHE). Research results concerning such spatially-explicit models lead efforts in preparation and mitigation of heat-related vulnerability and potential adaptation. The presented research analyzes the 1995 Chicago EHE in the context of a socio-environmental hazards approach, and fosters the development of an extreme heat vulnerability index (EHVI). The EHVI is a fused dataset consisting of census data and remotely sensed variables, which are examined in relation to geocoded mortality data. The presented analysis combines 25 well-known indicators of extreme heat-health risk into an applied index utilizing a principal components analysis. The developed EHVI presented a trend of higher rates of death in the highest risk zones to lower rates in lower zones of risk. The model explains nearly 80% of the total variance in the heat-health vulnerability variables utilized. This index could be utilized by city officials to assist in the mitigation of extreme heat events and is a further evolution of previously developed efforts. Our findings indicate extreme heat vulnerability models should likely be developed on a local level for a specific location, taking into account local variations in social and environmental vulnerability. © 2012.},

General circulation models of climate change predict that heatwaves will become more frequent and intense, especially in the higher latitudes, affecting large metropolitan areas that are not well adapted to them. Exposure to extreme heat is already a significant public health problem and the primary cause of weather-related mortality in the U.S. This article reviews major epidemiologic risk factors associated with mortality from extreme heat exposure and discusses future drivers of heat-related mortality, including a warming climate, the urban heat island effect, and an aging population. In addition, it considers critical areas of an effective public health response including heat response plans, the use of remote sensing and GIS methodologies, and the importance of effective communications strategies.},

   abstract = {Heat-related mortality in US cities is expected to more than double by the mid-to-late 21st century. Rising heat exposure in cities is projected to result from: 1) climate forcings from changing global atmospheric composition; and 2) local land surface characteristics responsible for the urban heat island effect. The extent to which heat management strategies designed to lessen the urban heat island effect could offset future heat-related mortality remains unexplored in the literature. Using coupled global and regional climate models with a human health effects model, we estimate changes in the number of heat-related deaths in 2050 resulting from modifications to vegetative cover and surface albedo across three climatically and demographically diverse US metropolitan areas: Atlanta, Georgia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Phoenix, Arizona. Employing separate health impact functions for average warm season and heat wave conditions in 2050, we find combinations of vegetation and albedo enhancement to offset projected increases in heat-related mortality by 40 to 99% across the three metropolitan regions. These results demonstrate the potential for extensive land surface changes in cities to provide adaptive benefits to urban populations at risk for rising heat exposure with climate change.},

   abstract = {The urban heat island (UHI), together with summertime heat waves, foster's biophysical hazards such as heat stress, air pollution, and associated public health problems. Mitigation strategies such as increased vegetative cover and higher albedo surface materials have been proposed. Atlanta, Georgia, is often affected by extreme heat, and has recently been investigated to better understand its heat island and related weather modifications. The objectives of this research were to (1) characterize temporal variations in the magnitude of UHI around Metro Atlanta area, (2) identify climatological attributes of the UHI under extremely high temperature conditions during Atlanta's summer (June, July, and August) period, and (3) conduct theoretical numerical simulations to quantify the first-order effects of proposed mitigation strategies. Over the period 1984-2007, the climatological mean UHI magnitude for Atlanta-Athens and Athens-Monticello was 1.31 and 1.71°C, respectively. There were statistically significant minimum temperature trends of 0.70°C per decade at Athens and -1.79°C per decade at Monticello while Atlanta's minimum temperature remained unchanged. The largest (smallest) UHI magnitudes were in spring (summer) and may be coupled to cloud-radiative cycles. Heat waves in Atlanta occurred during 50% of the years spanning 1984-2007 and were exclusively summertime phenomena. The mean number of heat wave events in Atlanta during a given heat wave year was 1.83. On average, Atlanta heat waves lasted 14.18 days, although there was quite a bit of variability (standard deviation of 9.89). The mean maximum temperature during Atlanta's heat waves was 35.85°C. The Atlanta-Athens UHI was not statistically larger during a heat wave although the Atlanta-Monticello UHI was. Model simulations captured daytime and nocturnal UHIs under heat wave conditions. Sensitivity results suggested that a 100% increase in Atlanta's surface vegetation or a tripling of its albedo effectively reduced UHI surface temperature. However, from a mitigation and technological standpoint, there is low feasibility of tripling albedo in the foreseeable future. Increased vegetation seems to be a more likely choice for mitigating surface temperature. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

   abstract = {Many newly built, energy-efficient terraced houses are characterised by high indoor air temperatures and thermal comfort issues, because these state-of-the-art houses were designed and built without considering the warming climate conditions in the summer. As a result, many of these residential buildings are at risk of overheating and require careful implementation of passive cooling design systems when retrofitting. This study reviews the overheating risk and energy effectiveness of six passive design strategies tested and implemented in an innovative terraced house located in southeast London during the long-term heatwaves experienced in both the UK and continental Europe in the summer of 2018. A quantitative research methodology is employed based on an extensive monitoring campaign conducted to measure environmental conditions, including indoor air temperature, relative humidity and CO2 of each occupied space in a prototype base-case building. In the subsequent phase of the research, retrofit strategies were investigated by modelling and simulation using the Integrated Environmental Solutions (IES) software suite for data validation. The preliminary results of the modelling and simulation confirmed the survey findings of high levels of occupant discomfort and relatively high cooling loads. The internal operating temperatures of the simulated rooms remained high throughout the day and night during the long-term heatwaves, ranging from a minimum of 24.7 °C to a maximum of 32.1 °C. The results highlight significant deviations in the estimated energy consumption of the base-case building as well as in the energetic and environmental indexes of the passive cooling design strategies. The study will contribute to the strategic design of retrofit interventions to effectively reduce cooling energy consumption by considering occupants’ thermal comfort, thermal adaptation and energy use.},

   abstract = {Europe has been experiencing an increasing number of sweltering heat waves in recent years. This run of hot extremes induces a significant impact on the human environment, especially in terms of excess mortality, highlighting the urgent need for improved heat–health action planning. This is particularly true in countries situated in the eastern Mediterranean, which is considered a climate change hot spot. To increase preparedness and response to overheating risks, heat–health warning systems (HHWSs) are of vital importance. In this direction, the principal aim of the HEAT-ALARM research project is to provide a novel scientific and technological framework for the development of efficient HHWSs, employing Greece as a testbed. Going beyond the simple notion that outdoor meteorological conditions alone can adequately describe the heat–health nexus, a sophisticated human-biometeorological index, the modified physiologically equivalent temperature (mPET), is used. Advanced statistical models and tools are employed in order to establish a clear link between mPET and excess mortality at regional-unit administrative level. Moreover, urban climate factors produced by combining remote sensing and geographical information system techniques are incorporated into the HHWS via a state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction model. The latter includes a scheme that combines the parameterization and modeling of building effects and energy, respectively, in order to account for the urban indoor thermal conditions and the intra-urban differential heat exposure within the five highest populated cities of Greece (Athens, Thessaloniki, Patras, Heraklion and Larissa). Further, the human body’s acclimatization ability is considered, as well as the physiological characteristics of different vulnerable groups of people, including the elderly, women and outdoor workers. The current paper describes the scientific background of HEAT-ALARM and provides preliminary results associated with the project’s realization.},

In the context of the sustainable development goals, it is a key point to consider the reduction of the heat island effect in the urban environment. Considering this background and the proven absence of the clear promotion of urban mitigation measures, the research aims at investigating the influence on several micro-climate parameters of different retrofitting strategies at the building level (green façades) and the cooling strategies at the urban scale (e.g., cool pavements, trees). As a case study, the application of these measures in an industrial district located in Italy is evaluated. ENVI-met software was adopted to perform the outdoor environmental simulations, in order to assess the effectiveness of the mitigation strategies proposed, considering both the whole district and a portion, focusing on urban canyons. Cool pavements proved to be the most promising strategy to both reduce the air temperature and increase the relative humidity. Slighter effects on environmental conditions can be achieved by planting trees and installing green walls that, by contrast, significantly affect the mean radiant temperature and buildings’ surface temperatures, respectively.},

   abstract = {Urbanisation may have been shown to have no effect on climate change, but some researchers suggest that cities are fully capable of responding to it. Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) represent dense urban areas within cities where the temperature is recorded to be higher than the neighbouring areas or those located in suburbia. Mitigation of UHI effects can help diminish detriments of climate change. This paper sets out to establish UHI mitigation strategies, their effectiveness and resilience to help provide recommendations for application of such strategies in future. Existing literature suggest that UK is facing with growing problem of UHI effects and sustainable development at urban scale can be improved if proportionate measures are taken to mitigate those effects. The lack of guidance for designers and planners with regards to UHI mitigation is also indicated in the literature where trees, shrubs and grass (TSG), use of high albedo materials (HAM) in external building surfaces and urban inland water bodies (UIWB) are identified as effective measures to mitigate UHI. This research identifies and tests resilience and effectiveness of UHI mitigation strategies, using ENVI-met simulations and through Urban Futures Assessment Method (UFAM). Assessed mitigation strategies (TSG, HAM, UIWB) are shown to have a similar level of resilience which could be improved if proper future-proof measures are taken in place. As a result, some practical suggestions are provided to help improve the resilience of tested UHI mitigation strategies in this study.},

Heat health warning systems (HHWS) link public health actions to meteorological forecasts of dangerous weather. Such systems are being implemented in Europe in the absence of strong evidence of the effectiveness of specific measures in reducing heatwave mortality or morbidity. Passive dissemination of heat avoidance advice is likely to be ineffective given the current knowledge of high-risk groups. HHWS should be linked to the active identification and care of high-risk individuals. The systems require clear lines of responsibility for the multiple agencies involved (including the weather service, and the local health and social care agencies). Other health interventions are necessary in relation to improved housing, and the care of the elderly at home and vulnerable people in institutions. European countries need to learn from each other how to prepare for and effectively cope with heatwaves in the future.

   abstract = {Increasingly commonplace in cities, extreme heat events introduce multi-stress vulnerability, affecting people’s health and well-being, financial situation, mobility, social relations, and access to basic services. Planning to reduce heat vulnerability has become part of government business and to some extent community-level responses, cutting across a number of sectors including public health, emergency management, social services, critical infrastructure, and housing. This planning is often framed around heat as an emergency, focusing on preventing loss of life and severe health impacts, yet a vulnerability perspective also draws attention to the chronic and persistent impacts of heat. Our research, based on interviews and desktop research in Melbourne, Australia, found tensions between addressing heat as an emergency and heat as a source of chronic stress, with emergency responses taking precedence over responses addressing the chronic dimensions of heat. Each approach results in different but nonetheless related programmatic priorities for reducing vulnerability. In complex institutional settings, improving relations between policy and programme managers, non-government organisations, and vulnerable people themselves would enable the multiple stresses associated with extreme heat to be more effectively addressed. Policy and institutional responses that better appreciate the interconnections between the emergency and chronic aspects of heat would likely reduce vulnerability and contribute to more just approaches to urban sustainability.},

This paper describes the governance and institutional arrangements during the development of an adaptation strategy (herein referred to as heat-health policy) for heat waves in Adelaide, Australia. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted between June and August 2011 among 18 stakeholders who were involved in the participatory process during the development of the heat-health policy. Informed consent was obtained and interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and the data analysed using framework analysis. Interview data were supplemented by data gathered through a review of documents associated with the process. The results found that the process of developing the heat-health policy was initiated by the state government and comprised of stakeholders from both the state and non-state sectors. There was a high level of leadership and political commitment demonstrated during the process, given that the different players wanted a policy to be in place before any future heat wave. A Steering Committee was established that provided coordination and oversight in addition to the Emergency Management Act within the state which provided the legislative framework during the heat-health policy development process. Although the decision-making authority was controlled by a controlled by a public institution, to a larger extent, there was collaborative decision-making by virtue of the context in which the heat-health policy was developed. An assurance mechanism established during the process was among the factors that ensured accountability during the participatory process. Overall, the development of the heat-health policy in Adelaide was largely successful, attributed to the extent of political commitment from the state government and the sound institutional and legislative framework that facilitated the process. Good governance and institutional arrangements provide the enabling environment, the structures, systems and resources that would facilitate the development of adaptation strategies such as heat-health policies. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Here, using a modeling platform supported by detailed measurements of meteorological data, we report the first quantified analysis of the urban microclimate and evaluate the impacts of heat mitigation technologies to decrease the ambient temperature in the city of Darwin. We present a holistic study that quantifies the benefits of city-scale heat mitigation to human health, energy consumption, and peak electricity demand. The best-performing mitigation scenario, which combines cool materials, shading, and greenery, reduces the peak ambient temperature by 2.7&nbsp;°C and consequently decreases the peak electricity demand and the total annual cooling load by 2% and 7.2%, respectively. Further, the proposed heat mitigation approach can save 9.66 excess deaths per year per 100,000 people within the Darwin urban health district.

This phenomenon magnifies cities’ energy difficulties while reducing comfort. Mitigation strategies have been developed and recommended to deal with the issue. Methods to increase albedo and the utilisation of vegetation appear to be the most promising, with a reasonably high heat island reduction capacity. This paper examines the heat mitigation techniques and their effectiveness under Sydney’s climate conditions and compares strategies. We implement two perspectives, namely urban greening (green roofs, green pavements) and albedo (street, roof), and characterise urban surface structures, and Envi-met software is employed for our simulation method. Mitigation strategies show a cooling potential of 4.1 °C in temperature along this precinct during the heatwave period. Scenarios that increase high-albedo material on the road, pavements and rooftops and full mitigation show the maximum cooling potential. The mitigation strategies have higher predicted cooling potential on the peak ambient temperature, up to 1.18 °C, while having no or little impact on minimum ambient temperature. The outdoor thermal comfort based on PMV indices varies between a minimum of −0.33 in scenario seven in large layout areas to 3. However, the mitigation scenario presents more acceptable outdoor thermal comfort, but large layouts are predicted to have a hot condition.},

   abstract = {Extreme heatwaves in tropical cities represent a significant short-term weather challenge, directly impacting urban heat, exacerbating human discomfort, and increasing energy demands. To alleviate this, meteorological adjustments utilizing reflective roofing technologies, such as cool roofs, can effectively mitigate heatwave-induced excess heat and enhance thermal comfort. This study assessed the effectiveness of cool roofs in cooling urban areas following heatwaves in Kolkata, India, using comprehensive city-scale simulations. The study presumed that the existing roofing materials, with a reflectivity of 0.15 and emissivity of 0.85, indicated the unmitigated condition. These materials were replaced with third-generation cool roof materials featuring a reflectivity of 0.80 and emissivity of 0.85, leading to a substantial improvement in urban meteorology and thermal comfort compared to the unmitigated state. Notably, during heatwave episodes, the most significant computed reductions in energy flux were 181.3 Wm−2, 16.6 Wm−2, 56.3 Wm−2, and 251.9 Wm−2 for sensible heat, latent heat, ground storage, and net inflow radiation, respectively. Consequently, this led to decreases of 2.3 °C, 6.1 °C, 21.8 °C, and 1.9 °C in urban thermal parameters during peak hours (14:00 LT) for ambient temperature, surface temperature, roof surface temperature, and urban canopy temperature, respectively. The maximum drops in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) were 130.6 m, 1978.5 m, and 1010.3 m for 6:00 LT, 14:00 LT, and 18:00 LT, with an average of 870.3 m. Cool roofs demonstrated their potential to minimize thermal stress during heatwave periods, showcasing a maximum drop in the heat stress index (HSI) of up to 1.5 °C in the morning. Furthermore, outdoor thermal comfort could be significantly enhanced by lowering the universal thermal comfort index (UTCI) at the near surface, resulting in reductions of up to 1.8 °C during peak hours. On average, there was a reduction in UTCI between day and night of approximately 1.2 °C and 0.7 °C in densely populated urban areas. Additionally, the study evaluated 32 case studies that focused on cool roof strategies, revealing remarkably consistent findings that suggest a plausible justification. These findings provide a valuable framework for urban planners and policymakers considering the integration of cool roofs-based heat reduction technology at the city scale.},

   abstract = {Increasing average temperatures and heat waves are having devasting impacts on human health and well-being but studies of heat impacts and how people adapt are rare and often confined to specific locations. In this study, we explore how analysis of conversations on social media can be used to understand how people feel about heat waves and how they respond. We collected global Twitter data over four months (from January to April 2022) using predefined hashtags about heat waves. Topic modelling identified five topics. The largest (one-third of all tweets) was related to sports events. The remaining two-thirds could be allocated to four topics connected to communication about climate-related heat or heat waves. Two of these were on the impacts of heat and heat waves (health impacts 20%; social impacts 16%), one was on extreme weather and climate change attribution (17%) and the last one was on perceptions and warning (13%). The number of tweets in each week corresponded well with major heat wave occurrences in Argentina, Australia, the USA and South Asia (India and Pakistan), indicating that people posting tweets were aware of the threat from heat and its impacts on the society. Among the words frequently used within the topic ‘Social impacts’ were ‘air-conditioning’ and ‘electricity’, suggesting links between coping strategies and financial pressure. Apart from analysing the content of tweets, new insights were also obtained from analysing how people engaged with Twitter tweets about heat or heat waves. We found that tweets posted early, and which were then shared by other influential Twitter users, were among the most popular. Finally, we found that the most popular tweets belonged to individual scientists or respected news outlets, with no evidence that misinformation about climate change-related heat is widespread.},

   abstract = {Many cities are experiencing persistent risk in China due to frequent extreme weather events. Some extreme weather events, such as extreme heat hazard, have seriously threatened human health and socio-economic development in cities. There is an urgent need to measure the degree of extreme heat risk and identify cites with the highest levels of extreme heat risk. In this study, we presented a risk assessment framework of extreme heat and considered risk as a combination of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. Based on these three dimensions, we selected relevant variables from historical meteorological data (1960-2016) and socioeconomic statistics in 2016, establishing an indicator system of extreme heat risk evaluation. Finally, we developed an extreme heat risk index to quantify the levels of extreme heat risk of 296 prefecture-level cities in China and revealed the spatial pattern of extreme heat risk in China in 2016 and their dominant factors. The results show that (1) cities with high levels of extreme heat hazard are mainly located in the south of China, especially in the southeast of China; (2) the spatial distribution of the extreme heat risk index shows obvious agglomeration characteristics; (3) the spatial distribution of the extreme heat risk is still mostly controlled by natural geographical conditions such as climate and topography; (4) among the four types of hazard-dominated, exposure-dominated, vulnerability-dominated, and low risk cities, the number of vulnerability-dominated cities is the largest. The results of this study can provide support for the risk management of extreme heat disasters and the formation of targeted countermeasures in China.},

Risks are highest during extreme heat events (EHEs), which challenge the capacity of health systems and other critical infrastructure. EHEs are becoming more frequent and severe, and climate change is driving an increasing proportion of heat-related mortality, necessitating more investment in health protection. Climate-resilient health systems are better positioned for EHEs, and EHE preparedness is a form of disaster risk reduction. Preparedness activities commonly take the form of heat action plans (HAPs), with many examples at various administrative scales. HAP activities can be divided into primary prevention, most important in the pre-event phase; secondary prevention, key to risk reduction early in an EHE; 301},

   abstract = {The high mortality and morbidity associated with the 2009 heat wave across South Eastern Australia highlighted the need for effective heat-related health promotion and preventive strategies. The adverse health effects of extreme heat are largely preventable, and heat-related health promotion can advise the public about the dangers of hot weather and how to reduce health risks. The South Australian State Emergency Service has outlined a co-ordinated response system in their Extreme Heat Arrangements for South Australia. This paper evaluates the health impacts at the temperature trigger levels incorporated in this plan. Heat events in Adelaide between 1994 and 2009 were compared in terms of heat duration, heat intensity and their impact on mortality and ambulance call-outs.The health impacts for events meeting specific temperature triggers were estimated. Individual heat events varied in terms of estimated excess mortality and ambulance call-outs. Increased mortality was associated with heat events of 3 or more consecutive days with maximum temperature (T(max)) > or = 43 degrees C or average daily temperature (ADT) > or = 34 degrees C, while ambulance call-outs increased significantly at lower T(max) levels.The two events reaching the temperature triggers for an extreme heat warning were associated with a 44% (95% CI 26-63%) increase in mortality. The results support the temperature trigger for an extreme heat warning within the Extreme Heat Arrangements for Adelaide, and indicate a limited health impact at lower temperature triggers.},

   abstract = {Sequential climate hazards, such as “warm and wet” compound extremes, have direct societal implications for highly urbanized regions and agricultural production. While typically extreme temperatures and rainfall are inversely correlated during the summer, extreme humid heatwaves often lead to atmospheric instability and moisture convection, increasing the likelihood of extreme precipitation (EP). Little is known about how heatwave characteristics, such as peak intensity and duration, influence EP at a regional scale. Using high‐resolution, sub‐daily station‐based observational records over five decades (1971–2021) across India, we find a robust increase in the frequency of compound humid heat‐peak precipitation events in all seasons. Our sensitivity analysis of the impact of humid heatwave characteristics on the subsequent sub‐daily rainfall extremes reveals that, with an increase in peak heatwave intensity for a given heatwave duration, >50% of sites show an increase in the magnitude of rainfall; conversely, with an increase in heatwave duration for a given peak heatwave intensity, around 67% sites show a decline in sub‐daily rainfall extremes. An asymmetrical shift toward above‐average precipitation extremes in response to humid heat stress is mainly clustered around low‐elevation, densely populated coastal areas and the irrigation‐intensive Indo‐Gangetic Plains.Compound humid heatwave‐extreme rainfall events substantially impact society, as the sequential occurrence of such events has immense damage potential due to the limited recovery time compared to the situation where these events occur in isolation. Detecting spatiotemporal patterns in compound hot‐wet weather extremes is essential for disaster management, projecting future changes, and devising an early warning system for vulnerable populations. Using gauge‐based observations of more than five decades across India, we find a robust increase in the number of compound humid heatwave‐extreme precipitation events over climatologically homogeneous regions of India across all seasons. We analyze how the rainfall extremes depend on the characteristics of the preceding heatwave: we find that rainfall extremes increase with increasing heatwave intensity for more than 50% of sites; in contrast, rainfall extremes decrease with increasing heatwave duration for around 67% of sites. A shift toward higher rainfall in response to humid heat characteristics is apparent in densely populated coastal areas and irrigation‐dominated regions of the country.   We quantify the exceedance probability of sub‐daily rainfall peaks conditioned on preceding heatwaves   A significant upward trend in the frequency of compound heatwave‐extreme precipitation events is detected across all seasons   Sub‐daily rainfall peaks shows notable changes in their exceedance probability in response to changing heatwave properties   },

Here we develop a disaster footprint analytical framework by integrating climate, epidemiological and hybrid input–output and computable general equilibrium global trade models to estimate the midcentury socioeconomic impacts of heat stress. We consider health costs related to heat exposure, the value of heat-induced labour productivity loss and indirect losses due to economic disruptions cascading through supply chains. Here we show that the global annual incremental gross domestic product loss increases exponentially from 0.03 ± 0.01 (SSP 245)–0.05 ± 0.03 (SSP 585) percentage points during 2030–2040 to 0.05 ± 0.01–0.15 ± 0.04 percentage points during 2050–2060. By 2060, the expected global economic losses reach a total of 0.6–4.6% with losses attributed to health loss (37–45%), labour productivity loss (18–37%) and indirect loss (12–43%) under different shared socioeconomic pathways. Small- and medium-sized developing countries suffer disproportionately from higher health loss in South-Central Africa (2.1 to 4.0 times above global average) and labour productivity loss in West Africa and Southeast Asia (2.0–3.3 times above global average). The supply-chain disruption effects are much more widespread with strong hit to those manufacturing-heavy countries such as China and the USA, leading to soaring economic losses of 2.7 ± 0.7% and 1.8 ± 0.5%, respectively. A global&nbsp;high-resolution disaster footprint analytical model is developed to show substantial socioeconomic impacts from climatic change-driven&nbsp;heat stress through the global supply chain by 2060 due to direct and indirect effects on health and labour productivity.},

Here we show using observations and an ensemble of global warming simulations the combined impact of the El Ninõ/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon and long-term warming on regional SAT extremes. We find a robust relationship between ENSO and southeast Asian SATs wherein virtually all April extremes occur during El Ninõ years. We then quantify the relative contributions of long-term warming and the 2015-16 El Ninõ to the extreme April 2016 SATs. The results indicate that global warming increases the likelihood of record-breaking April extremes where we estimate that 29% of the 2016 anomaly was caused by warming and 49% by El Ninõ. These post-Ninõ Aprils can potentially be anticipated a few months in advance, and thus, help societies prepare for the projected continued increases in extremes.},

County-level socioeconomic and demographic data were used to construct an index of social vulnerability to environmental hazards, called the Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) for the United States based on 1990 data. Methods. Using a factor analytic approach, 42 variables were reduced to 11 independent factors that accounted for about 76 percent of the variance. These factors were placed in an additive model to compute a summary score - the Social Vulnerability Index. Results. There are some distinct spatial patterns in the SoVI, with the most vulnerable counties clustered in metropolitan counties in the east, south Texas, and the Mississippi Delta region. Conclusion. Those factors that contribute to the overall score often are different for each county, underscoring the interactive nature of social vulnerability - some components increase vulnerability; others moderate the effects.},

   abstract = {Despite their adverse impacts, definitions and measurements of heat waves are ambiguous and inconsistent, generally being endemic to only the group affected, or the respective study reporting the analysis. The present study addresses this issue by employing a set of three heat wave definitions, derived from surveying heatrelated indices in the climate science literature. The definitions include three or more consecutive days above one of the following: the 90th percentile for maximum temperature, the 90th percentile for minimum temperature, and positive extreme heat factor (EHF) conditions. Additionally, each index is studied using a multiaspect framework measuring heat wave number, duration, participating days, and the peak and mean magnitudes. Observed climatologies and trends computed by Sen's Kendall slope estimator are presented for the Australian continent for two time periods (1951-2008 and 1971-2008). Trends in all aspects and definitions are smaller in magnitude but more significant for 1951-2008 than for 1971-2008. Considerable similarities exist in trends of the yearly number of days participating in a heat wave and yearly heat wave frequency, suggesting that the number of available heat wave days drives the number of events. Larger trends in the hottest part of a heat wave suggest that heat wave intensity is increasing faster than the mean magnitude. Although the direct results of this study cannot be inferred for other regions, the methodology has been designed as such that it is widely applicable. Furthermore, it includes a range of definitions that may be useful for a wide range of systems impacted by heat waves. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

   abstract = {This study examines the impact of a changing climate on heat-related mortality in 40 large cities in the United States. A synoptic climatological procedure, the spatial synoptic classification, is used to evaluate present climate-mortality relationships and project how potential climate changes might affect these values. Specifically, the synoptic classification is combined with downscaled future climate projections for the decadal periods of 2020-29, 2045-55, and 2090-99 from a coupled atmospheric-oceanic general circulation model. The results show an increase in excessive heat event (EHE) days and increased heat-attributable mortality across the study cities with the most pronounced increases projected to occur in the Southeast and Northeast. This increase becomes more dramatic toward the end of the twenty-first century as the anticipated impact of climate change intensifies. The health impact associated with different emissions scenarios is also examined. These results suggest that a "business as usual" approach to greenhouse gas emissions mitigation could result in twice as many heat-related deaths by the end of the century than a lower emissions scenario. Finally, a comparison of future estimates of heat-related mortality during EHEs is presented using algorithms developed during two different, although overlapping, time periods, one that includes some recent large-scale significant EHE intervention strategies (1975-2004), and one without (1975-95). The results suggest these public health responses can significantly decrease heat-related mortality. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.},

   abstract = {Heatwaves represent a significant natural hazard in Australia, arguably more hazardous to human life than bushfires, tropical cyclones and floods. In the 2008/2009 summer, for example, many more lives were lost to heatwaves than to that summer’s bushfires which were among the worst in the history of the Australian nation. For many years, these other forms of natural disaster have received much greater public attention than heatwaves, although there are some signs of change. We propose a new index, called the excess heat factor (EHF) for use in Australian heatwave monitoring and forecasting. The index is based on a three-day-averaged daily mean temperature (DMT), and is intended to capture heatwave intensity as it applies to human health outcomes, although its usefulness is likely to be much broader and with potential for international applicability. The index is described and placed in a climatological context in order to derive heatwave severity. Heatwave severity, as characterised by the climatological distribution of heatwave intensity, has been used to normalise the climatological variation in heatwave intensity range across Australia. This methodology was used to introduce a pilot national heatwave forecasting service for Australia during the 2013/2014 summer. Some results on the performance of the service are presented.},

Here we show using observations and an ensemble of global warming simulations the combined impact of the El Ninõ/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon and long-term warming on regional SAT extremes. We find a robust relationship between ENSO and southeast Asian SATs wherein virtually all April extremes occur during El Ninõ years. We then quantify the relative contributions of long-term warming and the 2015-16 El Ninõ to the extreme April 2016 SATs. The results indicate that global warming increases the likelihood of record-breaking April extremes where we estimate that 29% of the 2016 anomaly was caused by warming and 49% by El Ninõ. These post-Ninõ Aprils can potentially be anticipated a few months in advance, and thus, help societies prepare for the projected continued increases in extremes.},

   abstract = {Heat early warning systems and action plans use temperature thresholds to trigger warnings and risk communication. In this study, we conduct multistate analyses, exploring associations between heat and all-cause and cause-specific hospitalizations, to inform the design and development of heat–health early warning systems. We used a two-stage analysis to estimate heat–health risk relationships between heat index and hospitalizations in 1,617 counties in the United States for 2003–2012. The first stage involved a county-level time series quasi-Poisson regression, using a distributed lag nonlinear model, to estimate heat–health associations. The second stage involved a multivariate random-effects meta-analysis to pool county-specific exposure–response associations across larger geographic scales, such as by state or climate region. Using results from this two-stage analysis, we identified heat index ranges that correspond with significant heat-attributable burden. We then compared those with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Weather Service (NWS) heat alert criteria used during the same time period. Associations between heat index and cause-specific hospitalizations vary widely by geography and health outcome. Heat-attributable burden starts to occur at moderately hot heat index values, which in some regions are below the alert ranges used by the NWS during the study time period. Locally specific health evidence can beneficially inform and calibrate heat alert criteria. A synchronization of health findings with traditional weather forecasting efforts could be critical in the development of effective heat–health early warning systems.},

The use of heat early warning and response systems (HEWSs) that integrate weather forecasts with risk assessment, communication, and reduction activities is increasingly widespread. HEWSs are frequently touted as an adaptation to climate change, but little attention has been paid to the question of how best to ensure effectiveness of HEWSs as climates change further. In this paper, we discuss findings showing thatHEWSs satisfy the tenets of an intervention that facilitates adaptation, but climate change poses challenges infrequently addressed in heat action plans, particularly changes in the onset, duration, and intensity of dangerously warm temperatures, and changes over time in the relationships between temperature and health outcomes. Iterative management should be central to a HEWS, and iteration cycles should be of 5 years or less. Climate change adaptation and implementation science research frameworks can be used to identify HEWSmodifications to improve their effectiveness as temperature continues to rise, incorporating scientific insights and new understanding of effective interventions. We conclude that, at a minimum, iterative management activities should involve planned reassessment at least every 5 years of hazard distribution, population-level vulnerability, and HEWS effectiveness.},

   abstract = {Based on the observational dataset SA-OBS and model outputs from the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble project, this study investigates heatwaves in Southeast Asia in the current and future warmer climate. A heatwave is detected when the daily maximum temperature exceeds the 90th percentile threshold at each grid for at least three consecutive days. Three characteristics describing the frequency, duration, and amplitude of heatwaves are examined, including the sum of heatwave days per year (HWF) satisfying the heatwave definition, the length of the longest yearly heatwave event (HWD), and the hottest amplitude of the hottest yearly heatwave event (HWA). Results indicate that increased global warming is associated with substantial changes in heatwave characteristics over Southeast Asia, with more frequent heatwaves, longer heatwave duration, and higher extreme temperatures. The increase in HWA has a linear growth against global warming levels with distinct regional differences between the Maritime Continent and the Indochina Peninsula due to their different heat content of lower atmospheric boundaries. In contrast, those in HWF and HWD have nonlinear growth characteristics. The projected warmer future tends to be associated with a higher risk ratio value with the occurrence of rarer extreme heatwaves relative to the current climate. These results reiterate the potential risks of extreme regional heatwaves if global warming is unrestricted.},

In its current development phase, the hazards that H-MHEWS predicts are floods, landslides, and extreme weather events. Potential hazard indices are obtained by using an overlay approach and resampling so that the data have a 100-m spatial resolution. All indices are classified into 4 status categories: “No alert”, “Advisory”, “Watch”, and “Warning”. Flood potential is produced by overlaying rainfall prediction at 3-hour intervals with the flood index. Landslide potential is produced by overlaying rainfall prediction with the landslide index. Extreme weather potential is divided into 3 categories, i.e. heavy rain, strong winds, and extreme ocean waves. The whole prediction is dynamic, following weather predictions at 3-hour intervals. The hazard prediction results will trigger a ‘Warning’ alert in case of emergency status. This alert will be set up in a notification system to make it easier for the user to identify the most dangerous hydrometeorological hazard events.},

Similar to the other terms related to disaster risk reduction, this concept has evolved over time to eventually result in a comprehensive framework, that includes features from the upstream phase, such as detection and forecasting tools and models, to the downstream phase that considers a people-centred approach. Based on this holistic conceptual framework, this paper attempts to assess the degree of adequacy and integration of early warning systems with reference to international standards using a multi-hazard perspective. The study is focused on the following Asian countries: the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and the Philippines. Results obtained provide an inventory of existing approaches and systems, showing common backgrounds and consistencies in their conceptualisation. In addition, the findings of this study highlight the strengths and weaknesses of Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems in each country considering their technical, legal, and socio-economic complexities. These findings are intended to support target countries to improve the availability and effectiveness of their warning systems.},

This paper suggests a method for an effective EWS for very short-term heavy rainfall with machine learning techniques. The EWS produces a warning signal when it is expected to reach the criterion for a heavy rain advisory within the next 3 h. We devised a selective discretization method that converts a subset of continuous input variables to nominal ones. Meteorological data obtained from automatic weather stations are preprocessed by the selective discretization and principal component analysis. As a classifier, logistic regression is used to predict whether or not a warning is required. A comparative evaluation was performed on the EWS models generated by various classifiers. The tests were run for 652 locations in South Korea from 2007 to 2012. The empirical results showed that the preprocessing methods improved the prediction quality and logistic regression works well on heavy rainfall nowcasting in terms of F-measure and equitable threat score.},

@article{Gordon2021,
   abstract = {There are millions of people worldwide using e-Learning platforms. However, people with disabilities still have problems using these platforms due to a lack of accessibility. In the present study, a model for the generation of the profiles of users with disabilities is proposed. This model enables e-Learning platforms to have information on users' accessibility needs as input for automated adaptation of its interfaces. This would enable equal access for all learners with and without disabilities. In this context, different studies related to the profiling of users on e-Learning platforms were identified and analyzed. The model presented considers the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) that can be implemented in the interfaces of the e-Learning platforms and the metadata that represent the accessibility needs of users based on Schema.org. The researchers used Unified Modelling Language diagrams to design the model and define a description of the interaction between users, user interfaces, WCAG, Schema.org., and the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) profile generated. The testing of the prototype was carried out using WAVE and ARC Toolkit. The validation with the support of forty-four users was conducted using the System Usability Scale (SUS). The most outstanding results of this study are the identification of WCAG success criteria that are automatically implementable, the inclusion of two special categories for combined accessibility needs related to the elderly and linguistics, and the automatic generation of the profile as an XML file containing the metadata needed to enable the adaptation of e-Learning platform interfaces.},

Therefore, it is necessary to develop easily accessible systems for computers to achieve their inclusion within the new technologies. This paper presents a project whose objective is to draw disabled people nearer to new technologies. It presents a vision-based user interface designed to achieve computer accessibility for disabled users with motor impairments. The interface automatically finds the user's face and tracks it through time to recognize gestures within the face region in real time. Subsequently, a new information fusion procedure is proposed to acquire data from computer vision algorithms and its results are used to carry out a robust recognition process. Finally, we show how the system is used to replace a conventional mouse device for computer interaction and as a communication system for non-verbal children. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
